<div class="blockquot left p0">

<p class="p0 in0 larger">“<i>Let us now praise famous men, and our<br />
fathers who begat us.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> names of the seventeen men, here
named “Leaders of the People,” are for
the most part familiar in our mouths as
household words. Those who triumphed, like
Anselm and Stephen Langton; or whose cause
triumphed, like Simon of Montfort, Eliot, Pym and
Hampden, are beyond any loss of fame. Those
who in high place quitted themselves like men and
died game (if the phrase may be permitted), as did
Thomas Becket and Sir Thomas More, have, for all
time, deservedly their reward. The unsuccessful
rebels, FitzOsbert (called Longbeard), Wat Tyler,
Jack Cade and Robert Ket, are hard put to get rid
of the obloquy heaped upon them by contemporary
authority; while the later rebels, equally unsuccessful,
Lilburne, Winstanley, Major Cartwright and
Ernest Jones, relying on the pen rather than the
sword, escaped the hangman, and in so doing
narrowly escaped oblivion. Good Bishop Grosseteste,
living out his long life, thwarted often, but
unmartyred, enjoys the reputation commonly awarded
to conscientious public servants who die in harness.</p>

<p>On the whole, re-perusing the records of these
seventeen men, who would altogether reverse the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
verdicts of time? The obloquy may be removed
when the work of the rebels is fairly seen, and it
may be judged that they deserved better of the State
than appeared when they troubled its peace. The
rebels of the pen, too, should be worthy of recollection
in this age, for they wrought manfully with the
weapon now at once so powerful and so popular.
The greater men of our series stand out higher as
the distance increases. So far readjusted, the
awards of history may be accepted.</p>

<p>But with all the differences of character, one common
quality binds these men whose stories are here
retold—a resolute hatred of oppression. And one
common work, successful or unsuccessful, was theirs—to
labour for the liberties of England and the
health of its people. The value of each man’s work
can only be stated approximately: it is difficult to
make full allowance for the vastly different parts our
heroes, statesmen and rebels alike, were called to
play. The great thing is, that whatever the part,
they played it faithfully, as they read it, to the end.
We may admit the degrees of service given: it is
impossible to do otherwise. Some of these Leaders
shone as great orbs of light in their day and
generation, lighting not only England, but all western
Europe—and still their light burns true and clear
across the centuries. Others were but flickering
rush-lights—long extinct now. But none were will-o’-the-wisps,
for all helped to show the road to be
travelled by English men and women seeking free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>dom,
and moving ever towards democracy. At the
least, we—enjoying an inheritance won at a great
price, and only to be retained on terms no easier—can
keep the memory green of some few valiant servants
of our liberties. What is wanted is a real history of
the growth of the idea of freedom and of popular
liberty in this country; and these rough biographical
sketches may be accepted as a contribution to the
materials for such a book. “Biography is a department
of history, and stands to it as the life-history
of a plant or an animal does to general biology.”</p>

<p>I have gone back to all the original sources to get
once more at the lives of these “Leaders of the
People,” and to see them as they were seen by their
contemporaries; but I have also done my best to
read what the historians of our own day have written
concerning them, and in mentioning my authorities
I have, in each case, given a list of the modern
books that seem to me valuable.</p>

<h3 class="left">ARCHBISHOP ANSELM AND<br />NORMAN AUTOCRACY
<span class="subhead">1093–1109.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> first real check to the absolutism of
Norman rule in England was given by
Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>The turbulent ambition of Norman
barons threatened the sovereignity of William the
Conqueror and of his son, the Red King, often
enough, but these outbreaks promised no liberty for
England. The fires of English revolt were stamped
out utterly five years after Senlac, and the great
Conqueror at his death left England crushed; but he
left it under the discipline of religion, and he left it
loyal to the authority of the crown, grateful for
the one protection against the lawless rule of the
barons.</p>

<p>The English Chronicler, writing as “one who
knew him and once lived at his court,” summed up
the character of the Conqueror’s life and work in
words that have been freely quoted through the
<span class="locked">centuries:—</span></p>

<p>“King William was wiser and mightier than any
of his forerunners. He built many minsters, and was
gentle to God’s servants, though stern beyond all
measure to those who withstood his will.... So
stark and fierce was he that none dared resist his will.
Earls that did aught against his bidding he put in
bonds, and bishops he set off their bishoprics, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
abbots off their abbacies, and thanes he cast into
prison. He spared not his own brother, called Odo,
who was the chief man next to the king, but set him
in prison. So just was he that the good peace he
made in this land cannot be forgotten. For he
made it so that a man might fare alone over his realm
with his bosom full of gold, unhurt; and no man
durst slay another man whatsoever the evil he hath
done him; and if any man harmed a woman he was
punished accordingly. He ruled over England, and
surveyed the land with such skill that there was not
one hide but that he knew who held it, and what
it was worth, and these things he set in a written
book. So mighty was he that he held Normandy
and Brittany, won England and Maine, brought
Scotland and Wales to bow to him, and would,
had he lived two years longer, have won Ireland
by his renown, without need of weapons. Yet
surely in his time men had much travail and very
many sorrows; and poor men he made to toil hard
for the castles he had built. He fell on covetousness,
and the love of gold; and took by right and
by unright many marks of gold and more hundred
pounds of silver of his people, and for little need.
He made great deer-parks, and ordered that whoso
slew hart or hind, him men should blind; and
forbade men to slay deer or boar, and made the
hare go free; he loved the big game as if he were
their father. And the poor men that were oppressed
he recked nought of. All must follow the king’s
will if they would live, or have land, or even a quiet
life.”</p>

<p>But now, in September, 1087, the great King
William was dead, with his life-work done; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
from the tyranny of a strong and just ruler, England
passed to the despotism of his fearless son, William
the Red, who was “terrible and mighty over his
land and his men and towards all his neighbours;”
in whose reign “all that was loathsome in the eyes
of God and righteous men was of common use;
wherefore he was loathed by well-nigh all his
people, and hateful to God as his end showed.”</p>

<p>There was much of the later Puritan in William I.
in the steadfastness of purpose, the suppression of
“malignants,” and determination to have justice
done, no less than in the sincerity for Church
reform, and the deep respect for the ordinances
of religion. No king of England worked more
harmoniously with a strong archbishop than
William I. with Lanfranc—save, perhaps, Charles I.
with Laud.</p>

<p>Then on the death of William I., followed less
than two years later by Lanfranc’s, came the
reaction in Church and State from the efforts after
law, religion, and social decency under the Conqueror’s
rule.</p>

<p>The Red King had all his father’s sternness and
strength, but was without any of that belief in
justice, that faith in the Sovereign Power of a
Living God, that desire for law and order, and
that grave austerity in morals, which saved the
Conqueror from baseness in his tyranny.</p>

<p>William II., unmarried, made the wildest and
most brutish profligacy fashionable at court. To
pay for his debaucheries and extravagances he
plundered all who could pay, in especial the Church,
enjoying the revenues of all vacant sees and abbeys,
and declining to fill up the vacancies so that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
enjoyment might remain. After Lanfranc, as the
king’s chief adviser, came Ranulf (nicknamed the
Torch, or Firebrand), a coarse, unscrupulous bully,
with the wit of a criminal lawyer. This man was
made Bishop of Durham, and Justiciar. For him
government meant nothing but the art of getting
money for his royal master, and silencing all
opposition.</p>

<p>For over three years there was no Archbishop
of Canterbury, and the Red King refused to fill
up the vacancy caused by Lanfranc’s death, preferring
to enjoy the revenues and possessions of
the see; a thing that was shocking to all lovers
of religion, and scandalous to those who cared for
public decency and the good estate of the country.</p>

<p>Eadmer, a contemporary, describes the condition
of England in those early years of William <span class="locked">II.:—</span></p>

<p>“The king seized the church at Canterbury, the
mother of all England, Scotland, and Ireland, and
the neighbouring isles; he bade his officers to make
an inventory of all that belonged to it, within and
without; and after he had fixed an allowance for
the support of the monks who served God in that
place, he ordered the remainder to be disposed of
at a rent and brought under his domain. So he
put up the Church of Christ to sale; giving the
power of lordship over it to anyone who, however
hurtful he might be, would bid the highest price.
Every year, in wretched succession, a new rent
was set; for the king would allow no bargain to
remain settled, and whoever promised more ousted
him who was paying less, unless the former tenant,
giving up his original bargain, came up of his own
accord to the offer of the later bidder: and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
day might be seen, besides, the most abandoned
of men on their business of collecting money for
the king, marching about the cloisters of the
monastery, heedless of the religious rule of God’s
servants, and with fierce and savage looks giving
their orders on all sides; uttering threats, lording
it over every one, and showing their power to the
utmost. What scandals and quarrels and irregularities
arose from this I hate to remember. Some
of the monks of the church were dispersed at the
coming of this misfortune, and sent to other houses,
and those who remained suffered many tribulations
and indignities. What shall I say of the church
tenants, ground down by such wasting and misery,
that one might doubt, but that worse followed,
whether escaping with bare life they could have
been more cruelly oppressed. Nor did all this
happen only at Canterbury. The same savage
cruelty raged in all her daughter churches in
England, which, when bishop or abbot died, at
that time fell into widowhood. And this king,
too, was the first who ordered this woeful oppression
against the churches of God; he had inherited
nothing of this sort from his father, but was alone
in keeping the vacant churches in his own hands.
And thus, wherever you looked, there was wretchedness
before your eyes; and this distress lasted for
nearly five years over the Church of Canterbury,
always increasing, always, as time went on, growing
more cruel and evil.”</p>

<p>There is no word of exaggeration in this pitiful
lament of Eadmer’s. England under William II.
was at the mercy of a Norman whose notion of
absolute monarchy was to bleed the land as a subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
province. Courageous in battle he was, and skilful
in arms, but utterly heedless of the welfare of the
people he ruled. It was enough for the Red King
if his demands for money were met. There was no
one strong enough to gainsay his will, or stand
before him as the prophets of old stood before the
kings of Israel, until Anselm came to Canterbury.
It is only in the utterances of men like Eadmer we
learn something of the misery of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The king was with his court at Gloucester at
Christmas, 1092, and Anselm, then abbot of the
famous monastery of Bec in Normandy, was in
England at that time; partly to comfort his friend,
Earl Hugh of Chester, who was sick, and partly to
attend to the English affairs of his monastery.</p>

<p>Anselm was known as the friend of Lanfranc.
He had been a welcome guest at the court of the
Conqueror and in the cloisters at Canterbury. His
character stood high above all contemporaries in
England or Normandy. Anselm was surely the right
man to be made archbishop, and so put an end to a
state of things which even to the turbulent barons
was discreditable to the country.</p>

<p>The Red King bade Anselm come to his court,
and received him with great display of honour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Then came a private interview, and Anselm at once
told the king how men spoke ill of his misrule:
“Openly or secretly things were daily said of him
by nearly all the men of his realm which were not
seemly for the king’s dignity.” They parted, and
Anselm was busy for some time in England. When
the abbot wished to return to Bec William refused
him leave to quit the country.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Lent, March, 1093, the king
was lying sick at Gloucester. It was believed the
sickness was mortal. Certainly the king thought
himself dying. Anselm was summoned to minister
to him, and on his arrival bade the king “make a
clean confession of all that he knows that he has
done against God, and promise that, should he
recover, he will without pretence amend in all things.
The king at once agreed to this, and with sorrow of
heart engaged to do all that Anselm required, and to
keep justice and mercy all his life long. To this he
pledged his faith, and made his bishops witnesses
between himself and God, sending persons in his
stead to promise his word to God on the altar. An
Edict was written and sealed with the king’s seal
that all prisoners should be set free in all his dominions,
all debts forgiven, all offences heretofore committed
pardoned and forgotten for ever. Further,
good and holy laws were promised to the whole
people, and the sacred upholding of right and such
solemn inquest into wrongdoing as may deter
others.”</p>

<p>Thus Eadmer.</p>

<p>Florence of Worcester puts the matter more
briefly. “When the king thought himself about to
die he vowed to God, as his barons advised him, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
amend his life, to sell no more churches nor farm
them out, but to defend them by his kingly
might, and to end all bad laws and to establish just
laws.”</p>

<p>There was still the vacant archbishopric to be
filled, and the king named Anselm for Canterbury.</p>

<p>In vain Anselm pleaded that he was an old man—he
was then sixty—and unfit for so great a responsibility,
that he was a monk and had shunned the
business of the world.</p>

<p>The bishops assembled round the sick king’s bed
would not hear the refusal. Here was religion well
nigh destroyed in England, and evil rampant, and
the Church of God stricken almost to death, and at
such a time was Anselm to prefer his own ease and
quiet to the call to deliver Canterbury from its
bondage? By main force they placed a pastoral
staff within his hands, and while the crowd shouted
“Long live the bishop!” he was “carried rather
than led to a neighbouring church.” The king at
once ordered that Anselm should be invested with
all the temporal rights of the see, as Lanfranc had
held them, and in September, 1093, Anselm was
enthroned at Canterbury, and in December he was
consecrated.</p>

<p>Anselm warned the bishops and nobles when they
forced the archbishopric upon him that they were
making a mistake. “You have yoked to the plough
a poor weak sheep with a wild bull,” he said. “This
plough is the Church of God, and in England it has
been drawn by two strong oxen, the king and the
Archbishop of Canterbury, one to do justice and
to hold power in the things of this world, the other
to teach and govern in the things eternal. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Lanfranc is dead, and with his untamed companion
you have joined an old and feeble sheep.”</p>

<p>That the king and the archbishop were unevenly
yoked was manifest on William’s recovery, but it
was no poor sheep with whom Rufus had to deal,
but a man as brave and steadfast as he was gentle
and wise.</p>

<p>Trouble began at once when William rose from
his sick-bed. Anselm was now enthroned and no
attempt was made to revoke the appointment. But
the king’s promises of public amendment were
broken without hesitation. The pardoned prisoners
were seized, the cancelled debts redemanded and the
proceedings against offenders revived.</p>

<p>“Then was there so great misery and suffering
through the whole realm that no one can remember
to have seen its like in England. All the evil
which the king had wrought before he was sick
seemed good by the side of the wrong which he did
when he was returned to health.”</p>

<p>The king wanting money for his expedition
against his brother, Robert of Normandy, tried
to persuade Anselm to allow the Church lands,
bestowed since Lanfranc’s death on vassals of the
crown on tenure of military service, to remain with
their holders. He was answered by steady refusal.
Had Anselm yielded, he would have been a party to
the alienation of lands, that, as part of the property
of the see, he was bound to administer for the
common good; he would have been a party not
only to the spoiling of the Church, but to the
robbery of the poor and needy, whose claims, in
those days, to temporal assistance from Church
estates were not disputed. Any subsequent restitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of such lands was impossible, he foresaw, if it
was shown that the archbishop had confirmed what
the king had done.</p>

<p>Then came the question of a present of money to
the king. Anselm brought five hundred marks,
and, but for his counsellors and men of arms, who
told him the archbishop ought to have given twice
as much, William would have taken the gift gladly
enough. As it was, to show his dissatisfaction, the
money was returned. Anselm went boldly to the
king and warned him that money freely given was
better than a forced tribute. To this frank rebuke
of the extortion practised by the king’s servants,
William answered that he wanted neither his money,
nor his preaching, nor his company. Anselm retired
not altogether displeased at the refusal, for too
many of the clergy bought church offices by these
free gifts after they were instituted. In vain his
friends urged him to seek the king’s favour by
increasing his present, Anselm gave the five hundred
marks to the poor, and shook his head at the idea of
buying the king’s favour.</p>

<p>But if Anselm declined to walk in the path of
corruption to oblige the king, William was equally
resolute to make the path of righteousness a hard
road for the archbishop.</p>

<p>In February, 1094, when the Red King was at
Hastings waiting to cross to Normandy, Anselm
appealed to him to sanction a council of bishops,
whose decisions approved by the crown should have
the authority of law. There were two things for
such a council to do: (1) stop the open vice and
profligacy which ravaged the land; (2) find abbots
for the many monasteries then without heads. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Anselm’s words, the council was “to restore the Christian
religion which was well-nigh dead in so many.”</p>

<p>William treated the request with angry contempt,
and when Anselm sent bishops to him asking why
the king refused him friendship, an evasive answer
was returned.</p>

<p>“Give him money,” said the bishops again to
Anselm, “if you want peace with him. Give him the
five hundred marks, and promise him as much more,
and you will have the royal friendship. This, it
seems to us, is the only way out of the difficulty.”</p>

<p>But it was not Anselm’s way. He would not even
offer what had been rejected. “Besides, the greater
part of it was spent on the poor.”</p>

<p>William burst out into wrathful speech when he
was told of this reply. “Never will I hold him as
my father and archbishop, and ever shall I hate him
with bitter hatred. I hated him much yesterday,
and to-day I hate him still more.”</p>

<p>A year later (March, 1095) at a great council of
bishops and nobles, held at the castle of Rockingham,
the king’s hatred had full vent. From the first
the Archbishop of Canterbury received from the
Pope a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pallium</i>, the white woollen stole with four
crosses, which was “the badge of his office and
dignity,”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and Anselm was anxious to journey to
Rome to obtain his pallium from Pope Urban. William
objected to this on the ground that there was
another claimant to the papacy, and that until he
had decided who was the rightful pope no one in
England had a right to do so. In vain Anselm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
pointed out that he, with all Normandy, had acknowledged
Urban before he had become archbishop.
William retorted angrily that Anselm could only
keep his faith to the Apostolic See by breaking his
faith to the king.</p>

<p>The council of Rockingham met to settle the
question—not the question of the supremacy of
Rome in Western Christendom<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>—but the question
whether, in England, there was any higher authority
than the crown. William did not pretend to
dispute the papal supremacy in the Church. His
claim was that the king alone must first acknowledge
the pope before any of his subjects could do
so. In reality the king’s one desire was “to take
from Anselm all authority for maintaining the
Christian religion. For as long as any one in all
the land was said to hold any power except through
him, even in the things of God, it seemed to him
that the royal dignity was diminished.” (Eadmer.)
William acknowledged Pope Urban readily enough,
but he would have Archbishop Anselm understand
that the papacy must be acknowledged by permission
of the king of England. That was the
real ground of contention between these two men:
was there any power on earth higher in England
than the English crown? According to William, to
appeal to Rome was to dispute the absolutism of the
crown. Anselm maintained that in all things of
God he must render obedience to the Chief
Shepherd and Prince of the Church, to the Vicar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of St. Peter; and in matters of earthly dignity he
must render counsel and service to his lord the king.</p>

<p>The bishops at Rockingham were the king’s
men. Many of them had bought their bishoprics,
all were afraid of the royal displeasure. The stand
made by Anselm, unsupported though he was, did
something to inspire a better courage in the ranks of
the clergy<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>; but in that Lent of 1095 there was no
sign of support for the archbishop. William only
wanted to break the will of this resolute old man,
the one man in all the kingdom who dared to have
a mind and utterance of his own, and the mitred
creatures of the king supported their lord even to
the point of recommending the forcible deposition
of Anselm from his see, or at least of depriving him
of the staff and ring of office. With one consent
the bishops accepted the king’s suggestion of
renouncing all obedience to Anselm.</p>

<p>But the barons were not so craven. To the
king’s threat, “No man shall be mine, who will be
his” (Anselm’s), the nobles said bluntly that not
having taken any oath of fealty to the archbishop
they could not abjure it. And Anselm was their
archbishop. “It is his work to govern the Christian
religion in this land, and we who are Christians
cannot deny his guidance while we live here.”</p>

<p>The three days’ conference at Rockingham ended
in disappointment to the hopes of William of absolute
autocracy, and in general contempt for the prelates
whose abject servility had availed nothing.</p>

<p>Anselm alone stood higher in the eyes of the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
of England, and greater was the ill-will of William.
For another two years Anselm held his ground
against the king. The pallium was brought from
Rome by Walter, Bishop of Albano, and placed on
the altar at Canterbury, and Anselm was content
to take it from the altar. William had written in
vain to Pope Urban praying for the deposition of
Anselm, and promising a large annual tribute to
Rome if his prayer was granted. The pope, of
course, declined to do anything of the sort, and
William had to make the best of the situation. He
wanted money for his own purposes, and his barons
were now against him in his quarrel with the archbishop.
For a time William adopted a semblance
of peace with Anselm, but his anger soon blazed
out again. The ground of complaint this time was
that the soldiers whom the archbishop had sent to
the king for his military expedition against Wales
were inadequate—without proper equipment, and
unfit for service. The archbishop was summoned to
appear before the King’s Court to “do the king right.”</p>

<p>From the time of his acceptance of the archbishopric,
Anselm had been hoping against hope
that the king would support him, as the Conqueror
had supported Lanfranc, in the building up of the
Christian religion in England—this summons to
the King’s Court was the death-blow to all these
hopes. The defendant in the King’s Court was at
the mercy of the king, who could pronounce whatever
judgment he pleased.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Anselm returned no
answer to the summons, but his mind was made up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>“Having knowledge that the king’s word ruled
all judgment in the King’s Court, where nothing was
listened to except what the king willed, it seemed to
Anselm unbecoming that he should contend, as if
disputing, as litigants do, about a matter of words,
and should submit the justice of his cause to the
judgment of a court where neither law, nor equity,
nor reason prevailed. So he held his peace, and
gave no answer to the messenger.” (Eadmer.)</p>

<p>From the despotism of the Red King Anselm
would turn for justice to the centre of Christendom.
In England he was impotent to stem the evil that
flowed from the savage absolutism of the throne.
All that one man could do to resist the royal
tyranny Anselm had done, and now this summons to
the King’s Court was the final answer to all his
efforts to restrain a lawless king, and to promote the
Christian religion in England. He would not go
through the farce of pleading in the King’s Court,
where judgment was settled by the unbridled caprice
of the king, self-respect forbade the archbishop from
that; he would appeal to the only court on earth
higher than the courts of kings—the court whose
head, in those days, was the head of Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>William dropped the summons to the King’s
Court, and for a time refused permission to Anselm
to leave the country. Bishops and barons now
urged Anselm not to persist in his appeal to Rome.
But the archbishop was resolute, and in the autumn
of 1097 the king yielded, and Anselm left the
country.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>The first campaign against despotism in England
was over—the battle was to be renewed when
Henry I. wore the crown.</p>

<p>At Rome Pope Urban, with all the goodwill in
the world, and with a very real affection and regard
for Anselm, could do nothing against the Red King
except rebuke his envoys, and do honour to the
much-tried archbishop. Anselm himself prevented
the excommunication of William when it was proposed
at the Council of Bari, October, 1098.</p>

<p>But Pope Urban would not allow Anselm to
resign his archbishopric, and this in spite of all
Anselm’s entreaties.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1099 came a General Council at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Rome—at which Anselm assisted—a council remarkable
for its decision against allowing clergy to
receive investiture of churches from the hands of
laymen, and by so doing to become the vassals of
temporal lords. Excommunication was declared to
be the penalty for all who gave or received Church
appointments on such conditions.</p>

<p>It was at the close of this council that an outspoken
Bishop of Lucca called attention to Anselm’s
case. “One sits amongst us in silence and meekness
who has come from the far ends of the earth.
His very silence cries aloud. His humility and
patience, so gentle and so deep, as they rise to God
should set us on fire. This one man has come here,
wronged and afflicted, seeking judgment and justice
of the Apostolic See. And now this is the second
year, and what help has he found?”</p>

<p>Pope Urban answered that attention should be
given, but nothing further was done.</p>

<p>Anselm left Rome and went to Lyons, remaining
in France until the death of William in August,
1100. Henry was at once chosen king in his room,
and crowned at Westminster three days after his
brother’s death. Six weeks later, at Henry’s earnest
request—he prayed him “to come back like a father
to his son Henry and the English people”—Anselm
landed at Dover and returned to take up the task
allotted to him on his consecration as archbishop.</p>

<p>Henry at the outset of his reign promised “God
and all the people” that the old scandals of selling and
farming out the Church lands should be stopped,
and “to put down all unrighteousness that had been
in his brother’s time, and to hold the best laws that
ever stood in any king’s day before him.” That this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
charter was of value may be taken from the verdict
on the king by the Chronicler of the time. “Good
man he was and great awe there was of him. No
man durst misdo against another in his day. He
made peace for man and beast. Whoso carried a
burden of gold and silver no man durst do him
wrong.”</p>

<p>Two evils that pressed very hardly on the mass
of hard-working people, the devastation that attended
the king’s progress through the land<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, and the coining
of false money, were at Anselm’s instigation
checked by the king.</p>

<p>But with all Henry’s desire for the restoration of
religion and law in the land, he was the Conqueror’s
son, and for Anselm the struggle against absolutism
in government was not yet over. Only now the
battle was not with a fierce, untamed despot like the
Red King, but with an autocrat of an even more
formidable type, a stern man of business, in whose
person alone must be found the source of all law
and order, and who would brook no questioning of
the royal will.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his reign Henry found the
archbishop’s loyalty and good sense invaluable. As
Lanfranc had stood by the Conqueror in a marriage
which was objectionable from the point of view of
Church law, so Anselm stood by his son when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
sought the hand of Edith, daughter of the sainted
Queen Margaret of Scotland. Here the objection
to the marriage was not on the grounds of affinity or
consanguinity, but in the fact that Edith was an
inmate of the convent at Romsey, and, it was alleged,
a professed nun. Edith insisted that she had but
taken refuge in the convent to obtain the protection
of her aunt Christina, the abbess, and she had worn
the habit of a nun as a safeguard against the brutal
passions of the Red King and his courtiers. The
fear of violence at the hands of the Normans had
driven women to take the veil, and Lanfranc had
been known to grant release from vows taken under
such mortal pressure. Anselm was not the man to
exalt the letter of the law above the spirit of liberty.
He was content that a council of the great men in
Church and State should hold an inquiry, and on
their verdict declaring Edith free of her vows, the
archbishop gave his blessing on the marriage.</p>

<p>The same great qualities of loyalty and good
sense made Anselm stand by the king when the
Norman lords, pricked on by Ranulf the Torch, the
rascally Bishop of Durham (who had escaped from
imprisonment in the Tower by making his gaolers
drunk), and hating Henry for “his English ways,”
proposed to back up Robert of Normandy in his
attempts to seize the crown. According to Eadmer,
but for Anselm’s faithfulness and labours, which
turned the scale when so many were wavering, King
Henry would have lost the sovereignty of the realm
of England at that time.</p>

<p>But Anselm’s services to the king are of small
account by the side of his services to English liberty,
and Anselm’s resistance to Henry’s demands for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
absolute monarchy was of lasting influence in the
centuries that followed.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The struggle began when Henry called upon
Anselm for a new declaration of homage to the
crown, and required him to receive the archbishopric
afresh by a new act of investiture. This was a
claim that had never been made before. “It imported
that on the death of the sovereign the archbishop’s
commission expired, that his office was subordinate
and derivative, and the dignity therefore reverted to
the crown.” (Sir F. Palgrave.)</p>

<p>Anselm met the demand with the answer that
such a course was impossible. Nay, the very ecclesiastical
“customs” which for some time past had given
the appointment of bishops and abbots to the crown,
and had made the bishops “the king’s men” by obliging
them to do homage and to receive investiture of
their office with ring and staff at the royal hands, were
now impossible for Anselm. The Council at the
Lateran, at which Anselm had been present, had
forbidden the bishops of the Church to become the
vassals of the kings of the earth, and Anselm was
not the man to question this decision. He had seen
only too much, under William the Red, of the curse
of royal supremacy in the Church. He had stood up
alone against the iniquities of misrule, just because
the bishops, who should have been pastors and overseers
of a Christian people, were the sworn creatures
of the king. Henceforth it was forbidden by the
authority that rested in the seat of St. Peter at Rome
for a bishop to receive consecration as a king’s vassal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>But if Anselm would be no party to what had
become an intolerable evil, Henry would not give
up the rights his father had exercised without a
contest. He was willing to do his best for the
Church, but it must be in his own way. “Pledging
himself in his own heart and mind not to abate a
jot of his supremacy over the clergy, he would
exercise his authority in Church affairs somewhat
more decently than his father, and a great deal
more than his brother; but that was all.” (Sir F.
Palgrave.)</p>

<p>Both Henry and Anselm recognized the gravity
of the issue. Were the bishops and abbots to
continue to receive investiture from the king they
were “his men,” and his autocracy was established
over all. Stop the investiture and the bishops were
first and chiefly the servants of the Most High,
acknowledging a sovereignty higher than that
exercised by the princes of this world, and preferring
loyalty to the Church Catholic and its
Father at Rome, to blind obedience to the crown.</p>

<p>In brief, the question in dispute really was—Was
there, or was there not, any power on earth greater
than the English crown?—a question which no
English king before Henry VIII. answered successfully
in the negative. In contending for the freedom
of the bishops of the Church from vassalage to the
crown, Anselm was contending for the existence of
an authority to which even kings should pay
allegiance. It was not the rights of the clergy
that were at stake, for the terrors of excommunication
did not prevent bishops from receiving
consecration on Henry’s terms, and Anselm stood
alone now, as in the days of the Red King, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
resistance to despotism. It was the feeling and
the knowledge, which Anselm shared with the best
churchmen of his day, that great as the power of
the king must be, it was a bad thing for such power
to exist unchecked, and that it were well for the
world that its mightiest monarchs should know
there was a spiritual dominion given to the successor
of St. Peter, and to his children, a dominion
of divine foundation that claimed obedience even
from kings.</p>

<p>Anselm put it to the king that the canons of
the Church, and the decrees of a great council
had forbidden the “customs” of investiture which
the king claimed; and he pleaded that he was an
old man, and that unless he could work with the
king on the acceptance of the Church canons, it
was no use his remaining in England, “for he
could not hold communion with those who broke
these laws”: Henry, for his part, was much disturbed.
It was a grave matter to lose the investiture
of churches, and the homage of prelates; it
was a grave matter, too, to let Anselm leave the
country while he himself was hardly established
in the kingdom. “On the one side it seemed
to him that he should be losing, as it were,
half of his kingdom; on the other, he feared lest
Anselm should make his brother Robert King of
England,”—for Robert might easily be brought to
submit to the Apostolic See if he could be made
king on such terms.</p>

<p>Henry suggested an appeal to the pope on the
question of the right of the crown to “invest” the
bishops, and Anselm, who all along was anxious
for peace—if peace could be obtained without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
acknowledgment of royal absolutism—at once
agreed.</p>

<p>The pope, of course, could not grant Henry’s
request. To allow the high offices of the Church
to be disposed of at the caprice of kings and princes,
without any recognition of the sacredness of these
offices, to admit that the chief ministers of religion
were first and foremost “the king’s men,” seemed
to Pope Paschal, as it seemed to Anselm, a concession
to evil, and the establishment of a principle
which experience had proved thoroughly vicious
and mischievous.</p>

<p>Then for nearly three years a correspondence
dragged on between Henry and the pope, neither
wishing for an open rupture, and in the meantime,
Henry, backed by most of the bishops and nobles
in setting at nought the canons which had forbidden
investiture, proposed to go on appointing and investing
new bishops as before.</p>

<p>Finally, the king appealed to Anselm to go to
Rome “and try what he could do with the pope,
lest the king by losing the rights of his predecessors
should be disgraced.”</p>

<p>Anselm was now (1103) an old man of seventy,
but he agreed to go; only “he could do nothing
to the prejudice of the liberty of the Church or his
own honour.” What Henry hoped for was that the
pope would grant some personal dispensation in the
matter of the royal “customs,” and he had tried to
persuade Anselm that such dispensation was sure
to be granted. Anselm did not believe the dispensation
possible or desirable, but left the decision
with the acknowledged head of Christendom at
Rome; and though for another three years Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
urged his suit, no dispensation could be wrung from
the pope. All that the pope would grant was that
the bishops might do “homage” to the crown for
their temporal rights.</p>

<p>At last, in April, 1106, Anselm returned to
England. The bishops themselves, who had sided
with the king against him, implored him to return,
so wretched had become the state of religion in
England in his absence. They promised to do his
commands and to fight with him the battle of the
Lord.</p>

<p>Henry, fresh from the conquest of Normandy,
sent word of his good-will, and of his desire for
the archbishop’s presence. The long drawn-out
battle was over, and the king had to be content with
“homage,” and to resign the claim to investiture.</p>

<p>“On August 1st (1107) an assembly of bishops,
abbots, and chief men of the realm, was held in
London, in the king’s palace, and for three days
the matter of the investiture of churches was fully
discussed between the king and the bishops in
Anselm’s absence. Then, in the presence of
Anselm and before the whole multitude, the king
granted and decreed that henceforth and for ever
no one should be invested in England with bishopric
or abbey by staff and ring, either by the king or the
hand of any layman; while Anselm allowed that no
one chosen for a bishopric should be refused consecration
for having done homage to the king.
This having been settled, the king, by the counsel
of Anselm and the chief men of the realm, appointed
priests in nearly all those churches in England
which had long been widowed of their pastors.”
(Eadmer.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>Victory rested with Anselm. The old archbishop
had done his best for the liberty of religion, and by
contending for this liberty he had wrought for
common freedom.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Later ages and struggles were
to bring out more clearly that some measure of
political and social liberty must follow the demand
for freedom in religion. “Religious forces, and
religious forces alone, have had sufficient influence
to ensure practical realisation for political ideas.”
(Figgis, <cite>Studies of Political Thought</cite>.)</p>

<p>Anselm’s life was nearly over, his work was accomplished,
a philosophical treatise “Concerning the
agreement of Foreknowledge, Predestination and
the Grace of God with Free Will” was written with
difficulty in the last years. Then his appetite failed
him, and all food became loathsome. At last he was
persuaded to take to his bed, and on April 21st, 1109—the
Wednesday of Holy Week—at daybreak
Anselm passed away.</p>

<p>Anselm’s name has long been enrolled in the
calendar of the saints of the Church Catholic, no less
is it to be cherished by all who love liberty. Well
may it be said of him, “he was ever a close follower
of Truth, and walked in noble companionship with
Pity and Courage.” Anselm’s plain good sense and
charity were conspicuous in his benediction of the
marriage of Henry and Edith, but these great
qualities were earlier displayed when Lanfranc consulted
him as to the claims of the English Archbishop
Ælphege to be canonised as a martyr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Ælphege had been slain by the Danes for refusing
to ransom his life at the expense of his tenants;
and Anselm replied to Lanfranc that he who would
die rather than oppress his tenants dies for justice’
sake, and he who dies for justice dies a martyr for
Christ.</p>

<p>His sympathy and humaneness shone out a
thousand times. There is the story Eadmer tells of
an abbot, who came to Anselm at Bec, and deplored
that he could do no good with the boys at his
monastery. “In spite of all we do they are perverse
and incorrigible,” said the abbot, despondently.
“We are always beating them, but they only get
worse: and though we constrain them in every way
we can, it’s all of no use.” “<em>Constrain</em> them!”
answered Anselm. “Tell me, my lord abbot, when
you plant a tree in your garden, do you so tie it up
that it cannot stretch forth its branches? And if
you did so, what sort of tree would it become a few
years hence when you released it? But this is just
what you do with your boys. You cramp them in
with terrors and threats and blows, so that it is quite
impossible for them to grow or enjoy any freedom.
And kept down in this way their temper is spoilt by
evil thoughts of hatred and suspicion against you,
and they put down all you do to ill-nature and dislike.
Why are you so harsh with them? Are they not
human beings of the same nature as yourself? How
would you like to be treated as you treat them?”
The abbot was finally persuaded that he had been
all wrong. “We have wandered,” he said, “from
the way of truth, and the light of discretion hath not
shone on us.”</p>

<p>There is another story which gives Anselm’s pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
and feeling of kinship with the whole animal
creation. It was when he was archbishop, and was
riding one day from Windsor to Hayes that a hare
chased by the dogs of some of his company took
refuge under the feet of his horse. Anselm at once
pulled up and forebade the hare to be molested, and
when his escort laughed gleefully at the capture, the
archbishop said: “You may laugh, but it is no
laughing matter for this poor unhappy creature,
which is like the soul of a departing man pursued
by evil spirits. Mortal enemies attack it, and it
flies to us for its life: and while it turns to us
for safety we laugh.” He rode on, and in a loud
voice forbade the dogs to touch the hare; which,
glad to be at liberty, darted off to the fields and
woods.</p>

<p>That Anselm never wavered in his tenderness for
the weak and oppressed may be learnt from the
great Church Synod held at Westminster in
1102—a council summoned on the strong request
of the archbishop. The slave trade was specially
denounced at this council as a “wicked trade used
hitherto in England, by which men are sold like
brute animals,” and a canon was drawn up to that
effect.</p>

<p>Anselm’s enduring courage and desire for truth
are conspicuous all his life. He fought single-handed
against both William and Henry, and no
weight of numbers, no world-wise talk from other
prelates could make him budge. If he withstood
the Red King and his court at Rockingham, equally
firm was he in withstanding the Norman barons
who were inclined to break away from their sworn
allegiance to Henry. No Englishman by birth or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
blood was Anselm, for he was born at Aosta, and
spent the greater part of his life on the Continent,
but he brought to England the finest gifts of life,
and gave them freely in service to England’s liberty.
He withstood an absolutism that threatened the
total enslavement of the nation, and the witness he
bore to liberty was taken up and renewed in the
centuries that followed. “Anselm was truly a great
man. So good that he was held a saint in his very
lifetime, so meek that even his enemies honoured
him, so wise that he was the foremost thinker of his
day, and the forerunner of the greatest philosophers
of ours.” (F. York Powell.)</p>

<h3 class="left">THOMAS OF CANTERBURY<br />
THE DEFENDER OF THE POOR
<span class="subhead">1162–1170</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">Fifty</span> years after the death of Anselm the
struggle with absolute monarchy had to
be renewed in England, and again the
Archbishop of Canterbury was the antagonist
of the crown, standing alone for the most part, as
Anselm stood, in his resistance to autocracy.</p>

<p>The contrast is great between the upbringing and
character of Anselm and of Thomas; but both men
gave valiant service in the cause of liberty in
England, and both are placed in the calendar of
the saints. For Thomas and Anselm alike the
choice was between the favour of the King of
England, the safe broad road of passive obedience,
and the following of the call of conscience on the
craggy way of royal displeasure; and to the everlasting
honour of these two men, and of the religion
they professed, they chose the steep and narrow
path with no faltering step, and followed the gleam,
heedless of this world’s glory, heedless of life itself.</p>

<p>Thomas was no monk as Anselm was, when the
king nominated him for the archbishopric of Canterbury.
His early life was not spent in the cloister
but in the employment of a wealthy London sheriff,
in the office of Archbishop Theobald, at Lambeth,
and as Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>The son of gentle parents—his father Gilbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
sometime sheriff—“London citizens of the middle
class, not usurers nor engaged in business, but living
well on their own income,” according to FitzStephen,
Thomas was the first Englishman to be made archbishop.
His gifts marked him out for high office.
Theobald had sent him abroad to study law at the
great school at Bologna, and at the age of 36 made
him archdeacon of Canterbury, at that time “the
dignity in the Church of England next after the
bishops and abbots, and which brought him an
hundred pounds of silver.” A year later, 1155, the
young newly crowned king, Henry II., on the advice
of old Archbishop Theobald, made Thomas the
Chancellor. Theobald, anxious about the present,
and apprehensive for the future—for the king was
very young, and those about him were known to
be hostile to the freedom of the Church and willing
to treat England as a conquered land—sought to
prevent the evils which seemed to be at hand by
making Thomas a partner of the King’s counsels.
He could say, after ten years’ experience, that
Thomas was high-principled and prudent, wisely
zealous for justice, and whole-hearted for the freedom
of the Church, and he held forth to the king on
the wisdom, the courage and the faithfulness of his
archdeacon, “and the admirable sweetness of his
manners.”</p>

<p>The appointment was made, nor could anyone
say that it was ill done, or that Theobald in his
recommendation, or Henry II. in his acceptance, of
Thomas for the chancellorship could have done
better for England.</p>

<p>The chancellor was magnificent, and his dignity
was accounted second from the king. Nobles sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
their children to Thomas to be trained in his service.
The king commended to him his son, the heir to
the throne. Barons and knights did homage to
him. On his embassy to the French king never
had been seen such a retinue of followers, and such
a lavish display of the wealth and grandeur of
England. The proud and mighty he treated with
harshness and violence. Yet it was said, by those
who knew him intimately, that he was lowly in his
own eyes, and gentle and meek to those who were
humble in heart. And in the courts of kings, where
chastity is never commonly extolled, or purity of
life the fashion, Thomas, the chancellor, was known
for his cleanness of living and his unblemished
honour. Many enemies he had, many who hated
him for his power; but never was breath of scandal
uttered against the chancellor’s private life, or
suggestion made that the carnal lusts and appetites
which, unbridled, play havoc with men great and
small, could claim Thomas for their subject.</p>

<p>He might be reproached by a monk for that he,
being an archdeacon, lived so secular a life, wearing
the dress of a courtier, and charging on the field
with knights in France, but it could not be alleged
that church or realm suffered neglect from the
chancellor. “By divine inspiration and the
counsel of Thomas, the lord king did not long
retain vacant bishoprics and abbacies, so that the
patrimony of the Crucified might be brought into
the treasury, as was afterwards done, but bestowed
them with little delay on honourable persons, and
according to God’s law.” (W. FitzStephen.)</p>

<p>The close friendship and warm affection of the
king for his chancellor were known to all. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
the day’s business was done “they would play together
like boys of the same age.” They sat together
in church and hall and rode out together. “Never
in Christian times were there two men more of one
mind or better friends.” It was natural on the
death of Archbishop Theobald, in 1161, that people
should point to Thomas as his successor, though the
chancellor shrank, as Anselm had done, from the
post.</p>

<p>“I know three poor priests in England any one
of whom I would rather see advanced to the archbishopric
than myself,” he declared earnestly, when
his friend the prior of Leicester (who also remonstrated
with him for his unclerical dress) told him
the rumours of the court. “For as for me, if I was
appointed, I know the king so through and through
that I should be forced either to lose his favour or,
which God forbid, to lay aside the service of God.”</p>

<p>Thomas uttered the same warning to Henry
when the king proposed the primacy to him. “I
know certainly,” he said, “that if God should so dispose
that this happen, you would soon turn away
your love, and the favour which is now between us
would be changed into bitterest hate. I know that
you would demand many things in Church matters,
for already you have demanded them, which I could
never bear quietly, and the envious would take occasion
to provoke an endless strife between us.”</p>

<p>But Henry’s mind was made up. Residing
largely in France, he would have Thomas, Archbishop
of Canterbury and Chancellor, to rule England
as his vice-regent. Six years had Thomas been
the king’s friend and chancellor, but the king did
not know at all the real character of his man, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
rather it was inconceivable to the royal mind that
Thomas, whom the king had raised from a mere
nobody, from Archdeacon of Canterbury, an important
ecclesiastic at best, to the chief man in the
realm, should ever dare set himself at variance with
the king’s will. Henry, with his untiring energy,
was earnest enough for good government in Church
and State under an absolute monarchy, and he
counted on greater co-operation with Thomas in
carrying out his plans, were the latter archbishop.
Hitherto, more than once the chancellor had succeeded
in moderating the king’s outbursts of wrath
against some hapless offender, but he had never
shown himself a partisan of the clergy at the expense
of the commonwealth,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and his lack of pride in his
order had even incurred rebuke, so little of the
ecclesiastic did this statesman appear.</p>

<p>Thomas understood the king better than the king
understood his chancellor. But his protests were in
vain. He was as surely marked for the archbishopric
as Anselm had been. Bishops of the
province approved and the monks of Canterbury
duly voted for the king’s chancellor in common consent,
Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of Hereford, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
afterwards of London, and the archbishop’s enemy
to the end, alone opposing the election.</p>

<p>“Then the archbishop-elect was by the king’s authority
declared free of all debts to the crown and given
free to the Church of England, and in that freedom
he was received by the Church with the customary
hymns and words of praise.” (Herbert of Bosham.)</p>

<p>On June 2nd, 1162, the Saturday after Whit
Sunday, Thomas was ordained priest and on the
following day consecrated bishop. (The new archbishop
instituted the festival of Trinity Sunday to
commemorate his consecration, and some 200 years
later the festival was made of general observance in
the Catholic Church.) The king realised the mistake
he had made within a year of the consecration.
The brilliant chancellor was no sooner archbishop
than he turned from all the gaieties of the world,
and while no less a statesman, adopted the life of his
monks—though never himself a monk—at Canterbury.
Henceforth Archbishop Thomas was the
unflinching champion of the poor and them that had
no helper, the resolute defender of the liberties of
the Church against all who would make religion
subject to the autocracy of the king of England.</p>

<p>Thomas was forty-four years old, in the full
strength of his manhood, when he was made archbishop,
and for eight years he did battle with the
crown, only laying down his charge at the call of
martyrdom.</p>

<p>The first disappointment to Henry was the resignation
of the chancellor’s seal.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> It was clear to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Thomas that he could no longer serve the crown and
do the work of a Christian bishop at the same time,
and he had accepted with full sense of responsibility
the see of Canterbury. There was no room for the
egotism that loves power, the vaulting ambition
that o’erleaps itself, or even the self-deception that
persuades a man holding to high position at sacrifice
of principle that his motive is disinterested, in St.
Thomas of Canterbury. More than once England
was to see in later years men who strove vainly to
serve with equal respect the Christian religion and
the royal will—the service always ended in the
triumph of the latter. Thomas was far too clearly-sighted
to imagine such joint service possible, and
for him, elected and consecrated to the primacy of
the English Church, there was no longer any choice.
As chancellor, keeping his conscience clear, he had
done the best he could for law and order as the
king’s right hand man. As Archbishop of Canterbury
his duty, first and foremost, was to maintain
the Christian religion and defend the cause of the
poor and needy.</p>

<p>But to Henry the resignation of the chancellorship
was an act of desertion, a declared challenge to
the royal supremacy. Henry II. was no more the
man than his grandfather Henry I. had been to brook
anything that threatened resistance to the king’s
rule.</p>

<p>Courtiers who hated Thomas were always at hand
to poison the ears of the king by defaming the archbishop,
and this, says William FitzStephen, was the
first cause of the trouble. Another cause was the
hatred of the king for the clergy of England, hatred
provoked by the notoriously disreputable lives of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
more than one clerk in holy orders. The battle
between Henry and Thomas began on this matter of
criminous clerks.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror and Lanfranc recognizing
that the Church, strong and well ordered, made for
national well-being, had set up ecclesiastical courts
wherein all matters affecting church law and discipline
were to be dealt with by the clergy, to the
end that the clergy should not be mixed up in lawsuits
and should be excluded from the lay courts.
Henry II. was not satisfied that criminous clerks
were adequately dealt with in these ecclesiastical
courts, where no penalty involving bloodshed might
be inflicted, and where the savage punishments of
mutilation had no place. Thomas was as anxious as
the king for the Church to be purged of abuses, but
he was resolved not to hand over offenders to the
secular arm. The archbishop was an ardent
reformer. “He plucked up, pulled down, scattered
and rooted out whatever he found amiss in the vineyard
of the Lord,” wrote a contemporary; but he
would shelter his flock as far as he could by the
canon law from the hideous cruelties of the King’s
Courts.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> It was not for the protection of the clergy
alone the archbishop was fighting in the councils
summoned by the king at Westminster in 1163, and
at Clarendon in 1164.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>“Ecclesiastical privileges were not so exclusively
priestly privileges as we sometimes fancy. They
sheltered not only ordained ministers, but all ecclesiastical
officers of every kind; the Church Courts
also claimed jurisdiction in the causes of widows and
orphans. In short, the privileges for which Thomas
contended transferred a large part of the people,
and that the most helpless part, from the bloody
grasp of the King’s Courts to the milder jurisdiction
of the bishop.” (Freeman, <cite>Historical Essay</cite>, First
Series.)</p>

<p>Before the climax of the dispute between Henry
and Thomas was reached at Clarendon, the archbishop
had resisted the king in a matter of arbitrary
taxation—“the earliest recorded instance of resistance
to the royal will in a matter of taxation”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>—and
had fallen still further in the king’s disfavour.</p>

<p>Henry was at Woodstock, on July 1st, 1163, with
the archbishop and the great men of the land, and
among other matters a question was raised concerning
the payment of a two shillings land tax on
every hide of land. This was an old tax dating
from Saxon times, which William the Conqueror
had increased. It was paid to the sheriffs, who in
return undertook the defence of the county, and
may be compared with the county rates of our own
day. The king declared this tax should in future be
collected for the crown, and added to the royal
revenue; and no one dared to question this decision
until Archbishop Thomas arose and told the king to
his face that the tax was not to be exacted as
revenue, but was a voluntary offering to be paid to
the sheriffs only “so long as they shall serve us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
fitly and maintain and defend our dependants.” It
was not a tax that could be enforced by law.</p>

<p>Henry, bursting with anger, swore, “By God’s
Eyes” it should be given as revenue, and enscrolled
as a king’s tax.</p>

<p>The archbishop replied with quiet determination,
“aware lest by his sufferance a custom should come
in to the hurt of his successors,” that, “by the
reverence of those Eyes,” by which the king had
sworn, not one penny should be paid from his lands,
or from the rights of the Church. The king was
silenced, no answer was forthcoming to the objector,
and the tax was paid as before to the sheriffs. But
“the indignation of the king was not set at rest,”
and in October came the Council of Westminster.</p>

<p>The king at once demanded that criminous clerks
should not only be punished in the Church Courts
by the sentence of deprivation, but should further
be handed over to the King’s Courts for greater
penalties, alleging that those who were not restrained
from crime by the remembrance of their
holy orders would care little for the loss of such
orders.</p>

<p>The archbishop replied quietly that this proposed
new discipline was contrary to the religious liberty of
the land, and that he would never agree to it. The
Church was the one sanctuary against the barbarities
of the law, and Thomas to the end would maintain
the security it offered. More important it seemed to
him that clerical offenders should escape the king’s
justice, than that all petty felons who could claim
the protection of the Church should be given over
to mutilation by the king’s officers. The bishops
silently supported the primate in this matter, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
they told him plainly, “Better the liberties of the
Church perish than that we perish ourselves. Much
must be yielded to the malice of the times.”</p>

<p>Thomas answered this pitiful plea by admitting
the times were bad. “But,” he added, “are we to
heap sin upon sin? It is when the Church is in
trouble, and not merely when the times are peaceful,
that a bishop must cleave to the right. No greater
merit was there to the bishops of old who gave their
blood for the Church than there is now to those who
die in defence of her liberties.”</p>

<p>But the bishops were wavering, fearful of defying
the king’s will. And when Henry, defeated for the
moment by the archbishop’s stand, angrily called
upon them to take an oath to observe in future
“the royal customs” of the realm as settled by his
grandfather, Henry I., they all agreed to do so,
adding the clause “saving the rights of their order.”
The king objected, calling for the promise to be
made “absolutely and without qualifications,” until
Thomas reminded him that the fealty the bishops
swore to give the crown “in life and limb and
earthly honour” was sworn “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">salvo ordine suo</i>,” and
that the “earthly honour” promise, which included
all the royal “customs” of Henry I., was not to be
given by bishops in any other way.</p>

<p>It was now late at night, and the king broke up
the council in anger, leaving the bishops to retire as
they would.</p>

<p>Henry was resolved to abolish the Church Courts
and destroy the protection they afforded. He would
have all brought under the severity of his law, in
spite of the archbishop. He knew the bishops were
wavering and were fearful of the royal displeasure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Thomas Becket, and Thomas Becket alone, was the
obstruction to the king’s schemes, and firm as Becket
might stand, the king would break down his opposition.</p>

<p>The very day after Westminster the king demanded
the resignation of all the fortresses and
honours Thomas had held under the crown since
he had been made chancellor, and these were
surrendered at once.</p>

<p>Then Henry tried a personal appeal, and once
more the two met together in a field near Northampton.
Henry began by reminding Thomas of
all he had done for him.</p>

<p>“Have I not raised you from a mean and lowly
state to height of honour and dignity? How is it
after so many benefits and so many proofs of my
affection, which all have seen, you have forgotten
these things, and are now not only ungrateful, but
my opponent in everything?”</p>

<p>The archbishop answered: “Far be it from me,
my lord. I am not forgetful of the favours which
God has conferred upon me at your hands. Far be
it from me to be so ungrateful as to resist your will
in anything so long as it is in accord with God’s
will.” St. Thomas, enlarging on the necessity of
obedience to God rather than to men, should the
will of man clash with the will of God, the king at
last interrupted him impatiently with the intimation
that he did not want a sermon just then.</p>

<p>“Are you not my man, the son of one of my
servants?”</p>

<p>“In truth,” the archbishop answered, “I am not
sprung from a race of kings. Neither was blessed
Peter, the prince of the apostles, to whom was committed
the leadership of the Church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>“And in truth Peter died for his Lord,” said the
king.</p>

<p>“I too will die for my Lord when the time comes,”
replied the archbishop.</p>

<p>“You trust too much to the ladder you have
mounted by,” said the king.</p>

<p>But the archbishop answered: “I trust in God,
for cursed is the man that putteth his trust in man.”
Then the archbishop went on to remind Henry of
the proofs he had given of his fidelity in the years
when he was chancellor, and warned him that he
would have done well to have taken counsel with his
archbishop concerning spiritual things than with
those who had kindled the flame of envy and vengeance
against one who had done them no wrong.</p>

<p>The only reply the king gave was to urge that
the Archbishop should drop the words “saving
their order” in promising to obey the royal customs.</p>

<p>The archbishop refused to yield, and so they
parted.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>At the close of the year the archbishop’s difficulties
had been increased by appeals on all sides to
yield to the king. The bishops were for peace at
any price, and the Pope, Alexander III., threatened
by an anti-pope, and anxious for the good will of the
king of England, sent an abbot to Thomas urging
him to give way, on the ground that Henry only
wanted a formal assent to the “customs” for the
sake of his dignity, and had no intention of doing
anything harmful to the Church.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Thomas decided to
yield. He went to the king at Woodstock and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
declared that the obnoxious phrase, “saving our
order,” should be omitted from the promise to observe
the “customs.”</p>

<p>Without delay the king ordered his justiciar,
Richard of Lucy, and his clerk, Jocelin of Balliol, to
draw up a list of the old “customs” and liberties of
his grandfather Henry I., and on the 29th of January,
1164, a great council was held at Clarendon to ratify
the agreement between the bishops and the king.</p>

<p>Sixteen constitutions or articles were drawn up,
and Thomas, over-persuaded by the prayers of the
bishops and the desire for peace, gave his promise
unconditionally to observe them. But no sooner
had he done so, and the articles were placed before
him in black and white, than he repented.</p>

<p>The very first article declared that all disputes
about Church patronage were to be tried in the
King’s Court, and was intolerable, because while the
State held it was a question of the rights of property,
the Church view was that the main point was the
care of souls, a spiritual matter for churchmen, not
lawyers, to decide.</p>

<p>The other articles which Thomas objected to, and
which the pope subsequently refused to ratify, decreed:
(1) That clerks were to be tried in the King’s
Courts for offences of common law. (2) That neither
archbishops, bishops, nor beneficed clerks were to
leave the kingdom without the king’s license. (This,
said St. Thomas, would stop all pilgrimages and
attendance at councils at Rome, and turn England
into a vast prison. “It was right enough to apply
for the king’s leave before the departure, but to bind
one’s-self by an oath not to go without it was against
religion and was evil.”) (3) That no member of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
king’s household was to be excommunicated without
the king’s permission. (4) That no appeals should
be taken beyond the archbishop’s court, except to be
brought before the king. (This was a definite
attempt to prohibit appeals to Rome, and Thomas
pointed out that the archbishop on receiving the
pallium swore expressly not to hinder such appeals.
The acceptance of this article left the king absolute
master.)</p>

<p>The last article, declaring that serfs or sons of
villeins were not to be ordained without the consent
of the lord on whose land they were born, was not
opposed by the pope, and the only contemporary
objection seems to have been raised by Garnier, a
French monk and a biographer of Thomas Becket.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Thomas had promised obedience to these constitutions,
but he would not put his seal to them. It
seemed to him that it was not only the old “customs”
that had been drawn up, but rather a new
interpretation of these customs. The great Council
of Clarendon was over. Thomas received a copy of
the constitutions and rode off, and the king had to
be content for the time with the promises delivered.</p>

<p>In abject remorse Thomas wrote to the pope
confessing his assent to the Constitutions of Clarendon,
and for forty days he abstained from celebrating
the mass. The pope, still anxious to prevent any
open rupture between the king and the archbishop,
wrote in reply that “Almighty God watches not the
deed, but considers rather the intention and judges
the will,” and that Thomas was absolved by apostolic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
authority. All the same, Pope Alexander III., without
in any way censuring Thomas, throughout the
long struggle with Henry never stands up roundly
for the archbishop.</p>

<p>Neither Henry nor Thomas could rest satisfied
with Clarendon. The archbishop had compromised
for the sake of peace, but his quick revulsion had
provoked a keener hostility in the king. To Henry
it seemed the time had come to drive Thomas out
of public life by compelling him to resign the see
of Canterbury. With Thomas out of the way
Henry could carry out his plans for a strong
central government, for bringing all under the
pitiless arm of the law. Thomas was the one
man in the kingdom who dared offer resistance,
and if Thomas was no longer archbishop and some
supple creature of the king was in his place, the
royal power would be absolute, for there seemed
no fear of any interference from Pope Alexander III.</p>

<p>There were plenty of the archbishop’s enemies
among the nobles at the court ready to fan the
king’s anger against Thomas, and by October, 1164,
Henry was ready to crush the primate.</p>

<p>Another council was summoned to meet at
Northampton, and now Archbishop Thomas was
to learn the full significance of the Constitutions
of Clarendon.</p>

<p>The first charge against Thomas was that he had
refused justice to John, the Treasurer-Marshal, who
had taken up some land under the see of Canterbury.
John had taken his suit to the King’s Court,
and Thomas was further charged with contempt of
the majesty of the crown for not putting in a
personal appearance at this court. The king now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
pressed for judgment against the archbishop for
this contempt, and the council ordered that he
should be condemned to the loss of all his moveable
property, and 500 pounds of silver was accepted as
an equivalent fine.</p>

<p>“It seemed to all that, considering the reverence
due to the king and by the obligation of the oath of
homage, which the archbishop had taken, and by
the fealty to the king’s earthly honour which he had
sworn, he was in no way to be excused, because
when summoned by the king he had neither come
himself, nor pleaded infirmity, or the necessary
work of his ecclesiastical office.” (W. FitzStephen).</p>

<p>It was not easy to get the sentence pronounced
against Thomas. Barons and bishops were willing
enough to stand well with the king, and they agreed
without contradiction to the fine. But the barons
declined to act as judge on a spiritual peer, and
insisted that one of the bishops must do this
business. Henry, Bishop of Winchester, at last,
on the king’s order, pronounced the sentence.</p>

<p>Thomas protested. “If I were silent at such a
sentence posterity would not be. This is a new
form of sentence, no doubt in accordance with the
new laws of Clarendon. Never has it been heard
before in England that an Archbishop of Canterbury
has been tried in the King’s Court for such a cause.
The dignity of the Church, the authority of his
person, the fact that he is the spiritual father of
the king and of all his subjects, require that he
should be reverenced by all.” For an archbishop
to be judged by his suffragans was, he declared,
for a father to be judged by his sons.</p>

<p>The bishops implored him to bow to the decree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
of the council, and Thomas yielded, “not being
willing that a mere matter of money should cause
strife between the king and himself.”</p>

<p>The next day, Friday, October 9th, the king
pressed Thomas more fiercely, calling upon him
to give account for large sums spent during his
chancellorship, and for various revenues of vacant
churches during that period. The total amount
was 30,000 marks.</p>

<p>In vain the archbishop urged that this demand
was totally unexpected; that he had not been
summoned to Northampton to render such an
account; and that the justiciar, Richard, had
declared that he was free of all claims when he
laid down the chancellorship. The king demanded
sureties, “and from that day barons and knights
kept away from the archbishop’s house—for they
understood the mind of the king.”</p>

<p>All Saturday Thomas was in consultation with
the bishops, most of whom expressed themselves
strongly on the king’s side. Henry of Winchester
suggested the present of 2,000 marks to the king as
a peace-offering, and this was done. But the king
would not have it. Hilary, of Chichester, said,
addressing the archbishop, “You ought to know
the king better than we do, for you lived with him
in close companionship and friendship when you
were chancellor. Who is there who could be your
surety for all this money? The king has declared,
so it is said, that he and you cannot both remain
in England as king and archbishop. It would be
much safer to resign everything and submit to his
mercy. God forbid lest he arrest you over these
moneys of the chancellorship, or lay hands on you.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
One or two less craven urged the archbishop to
stand firm, as his predecessors had done, in the
face of persecution.</p>

<p>“Oh, that you were no longer archbishop and
were only Thomas,” said Hilary, putting the matter
briefly.</p>

<p>All Sunday was spent in consultations. On
Monday the archbishop was too ill to attend the
council, but on Tuesday his mind was made up,
and when he entered the council it was with the
full dignity of an archbishop, carrying the cross of
the archbishop in his hand.</p>

<p>The bishops were in despair. There were all
sorts of rumours in the air. It was known the king
was full of anger, and it was said that the archbishop’s
life was in danger. The bishops implored
him to resign, or else to promise complete submission
to the councils of Clarendon. They said he would
certainly be tried and condemned for high treason
for disobedience to the king, and asked him what
was the use of being archbishop when he had the
king’s hatred.</p>

<p>Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London, declared contemptuously
of Thomas, when someone asked him
why he did not carry the archbishop’s cross for him,
“He always was a fool, and always will be.”</p>

<p>Thomas had now only one answer to the bishops.
He forbad them to take any part in the proceedings
against him, announced that he had appealed to
“our Mother, the Church of Rome, refuge of all
the oppressed,” to prevent any of them taking part,
and ordered them to excommunicate any who should
dare lay secular hands upon the primate.</p>

<p>Then, holding his cross, the archbishop took his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
usual place in the council-chamber, while the king
sat in an inner room.</p>

<p>In the face of personal danger all the strength
and courage of Thomas Becket were aroused. He
had yielded at Clarendon for the sake of peace, and
no good had come of it. He had submitted to be
fined rather than be involved in a miserable dispute
about money, and now he was threatened with
demands for money which were beyond his resources.
There was nothing to prevent the king piling up
greater and greater sums against him, till hopeless
ruin had been reached. He was powerless to withstand
such an onslaught. To Rome, “the refuge of
all the oppressed,” would Thomas appeal, and then,
if it seemed well to the pope, he would retire from
Canterbury. But he would not surrender his post,
however great the wrath of the king, unless it were
for the welfare of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>In the council-chamber Thomas sat alone, with
one or two clergy attending him, including Herbert
of Bosham and William FitzStephen, while the
bishops went in to the king’s chamber. Among
the nobles the cry was going up that the archbishop
was a perjurer and a traitor, because, after signing
at Clarendon, he now, in violation of those constitutions,
forbad bishops to give judgment in a case
that did not involve bloodshed, and had further
made appeal to Rome.</p>

<p>Then the king sent to know whether the archbishop
refused to be bound by the Constitutions of
Clarendon, and whether he would find sureties to
abide by the sentence of the court regarding the
accounts of his chancellorship.</p>

<p>Thomas again pointed out that he had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
called there to give an account of his chancellorship,
that on his appointment to the archbishopric he had
been declared by the king free of all secular claims,
and that he had forbidden the bishops to take part
in any judgment against him, and had appealed to
Rome, “placing his person and the church of
Canterbury under the protection of God and the
pope.”</p>

<p>At the end of this speech the barons returned in
silence to the king, pondering the archbishop’s
words.</p>

<p>But hostile murmuring soon broke the silence,
and Thomas could overhear the barons grumbling
that, “King William, who conquered England,
knew how to tame his clerks. He had put his own
brother Odo in prison, and thrown Stigand, Archbishop
of Canterbury, into a dungeon.”</p>

<p>The bishops renewed their pitiful chorus. Thomas
had placed them between the hammer and the anvil
by his prohibition: of disobedience to Canterbury
on the one hand, and of the king’s anger on the
other. They had given their word at Clarendon,
and now they were being forced to go against the
promises they had made. They, too, would appeal
to Rome against his prohibition, “lest you injure us
still more.”</p>

<p>All that Thomas could say was that the Constitutions
of Clarendon had been sent to the pope for
confirmation, and had been returned, rather condemned
than approved. “This example has been
given for our learning, that we should do likewise,
and be ready to receive what he receives at Rome,
and reject what he rejects. If we fell at Clarendon,
through weakness of the flesh, the more ought we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
to take courage now, and in the might of the Holy
Ghost contend against the old enemy of man.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>So bishops and nobles came and went between
the king and the archbishop, and the day drew on.
Henry allowed the bishops to stand apart from the
judgment, and demanded sentence from the barons,
and Earl Robert of Leicester advanced as the
spokesman of the council to where the archbishop
was sitting. The earl began to speak of the judgment
of the court, when Thomas rose and refused to
hear him.</p>

<p>“What is this you would do?” he cried. “Would
you pass sentence on me? Neither law nor reason
permit children to pass sentence on their father.
You are nobles of the palace, and I am your spiritual
father. I will not hear this sentence of the king, or
any judgment of yours. For, under God, I will be
judged by the pope alone, to whom before you all
here I appeal, placing the church of Canterbury
with all thereto belonging under God’s protection
and the protection of the pope.” Then he turned
to the bishops. “And you, my brethren, who have
served man rather than God, I summon to the
presence of the pope; and now, guarded by the
authority of the Catholic Church and the Holy See,
I go hence.”</p>

<p>So he passed out of the hall, no one gainsaying
his passage, though some plucked rushes from the
floor and threw at him. There were shouts of
anger, and again the cries of “traitor” and “perjurer”
were raised. The archbishop turned on Earl
Hamelin, the king’s brother, and Randulf of Brok,
who were calling “traitor,” and said sternly: “If I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
were not a priest, my own arms should quickly
prove your lie. And you, Randulf, look at home
(his cousin had lately been hanged for felony) before
you accuse the guiltless!”</p>

<p>His horses were at the gate, and a great crowd
that were afraid lest the archbishop had been killed.
St. Thomas mounted, and accompanied by Herbert
of Bosham, rode back to the monastery of St.
Andrew, where he had been lodging. The crowd
thronged him and prayed for his blessing all the
way until the monastery was reached, and then he
would have the multitude come in to the refectory
and dine with him. Of his own retinue of forty
who had come with him to Northampton, scarce six
remained; and so the places of those who had
thought it safer to desert their lord were filled by
the hungry multitude. It was the archbishop’s farewell
banquet, and he, the constant champion of the
poor, had those whom he loved for his guests that
day.</p>

<p>At nightfall, after compline had been sung and the
monks dispersed to their cells, the archbishop, with
three other men in the dress of lay brothers, rode
out from Northampton by the north gate, and at
dawn were at Grantham. Three weeks later
Thomas had reached Flanders, and the exile had
begun which was only to end six years later when
death was at hand.</p>

<p>It was useless to remain in England, hopeless as
Thomas was of any support from the bishops. He
could but appeal, as Anselm had appealed, to the
one court that alone was recognised as owning a
higher authority than that of the kings of this world,
the court of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>But Pope Alexander, still harassed by an anti-pope
set up by the Emperor Frederick, could do as little
for Thomas as his predecessor had done for Anselm,
though he refused to allow him to resign the
archbishopric. Unlike Anselm, Thomas vigorously
carried on his contest with the king from the
friendly shelter of King Louis of France, and
Henry retaliated without hesitation, driving out of
England all the friends and kinsmen of Thomas, to
the number of four hundred, and threatening a like
banishment to the Cistercian monks, because
Thomas had taken refuge in their monastery at
Pontigny.</p>

<p>The fear that the pope would allow the archbishop
to pronounce an interdict against England, and a
sentence of personal excommunication against its
king, drove Henry in 1166 to appeal himself to the
pope. “Thus by a strange fate it happened that
the king, while striving for those ‘ancient customs,’
by which he endeavoured to prevent any right of
appeal (to the pope), was doomed to confirm the
right of appeal for his own safety.” (John of
Salisbury.)</p>

<p>Months and years passed in correspondence.
More than once Henry and Thomas met at the
court of Louis, but neither would yield. The
pope, without blaming the archbishop, and without
sanctioning any extreme step against Henry, did
what he could to make peace between them.</p>

<p>At last, in the summer of 1170, the king really
was disturbed by the fear of an interdict, for his last
act against Archbishop Thomas had been to have his
son crowned by the Archbishop of York, in defiance
of all the rights and privileges of the see of Canterbury.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Besides this, Louis was threatening war
because his daughter, who was married to the young
King Henry, had not been crowned with her
husband. Henry hastened over to France and
made friends with Thomas, and the reconciliation
took place at Freteral. The king solemnly promised
that the archbishop should enjoy all the possessions
and rights of which he had been deprived in his
exile, and that his friends and kinsmen should all be
allowed to return home. He even apologised for
the coronation of his son. It seemed as if the old
friendship had been revived. “We conversed
together until the evening as familiarly as in the
days of our ancient friendship. And it was agreed
I should arrange my affairs and then make some
stay with the king before embarking for England;
that the world might know how thoroughly we are
restored to his favour and intimacy. We are not
afraid that the king will not fulfil his promises,
unless he is misled by evil counsellors.” So Thomas
wrote to the pope in July, 1170. Yet there were
many—including King Louis—who doubted the
sincerity of the reconciliation, for Henry was not
willing to give the kiss of peace to his archbishop.</p>

<p>On December 1st Thomas landed at Sandwich,
and went at once to Canterbury. The townspeople
and the poor of the land welcomed him with enthusiastic
devotion. “Small and great, old and young,
ran together, some throwing themselves in his way,
others crying and exclaiming, ‘Blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord.’ In the same
manner the clergy and their parishioners met him in
procession, saluting their father and begging his
blessing.... And when all things in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
cathedral was solemnly ended, the archbishop went
to his palace, and so ended that joyful and solemn
day.” (Herbert of Bosham.)</p>

<p>But against the affection and goodwill of his own
people at Canterbury, and a similar demonstration of
rejoicing by multitudes of clergy and people in
London, Thomas had to face the fact that the
bishops generally hated his return, that the young
Prince Henry, recently crowned, who had been his
pupil, refused to see him and ordered his return to
Canterbury, and that the nobles openly spoke of
him as a traitor to the king. “This is a peace for
us which is no peace, but rather war,” said the
archbishop bitterly.</p>

<p>The end was not far off. Thomas, as zealous for
good discipline in the Church as Henry was for
strong authority in the State, was no sooner returned
than he was asked to withdraw the sentence of
excommunication against the Archbishop of York
and the Bishops of London and Salisbury. He
promised to do this if the bishops on their part
would promise to submit to the decision of the pope
on the matter. London and Salisbury were moved
to receive absolution on these terms, but Roger, of
York, who had always been against Becket, dissuaded
them, urging them to throw themselves on
the protection of the king, and threatening Thomas
“with marvellous and terrible things at the hands of
the king” unless he relented. Naturally, these
threats left the archbishop undisturbed, and Roger
of York, with Gilbert Foliot of London and Jocelin
of Salisbury, at once hastened over to France to lay
their case before the king.</p>

<p>These bishops were not the only men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
troubled Thomas in these last days. Randulf de
Broc, with others of his family, and certain
knights, all known as strong “king’s men,” “sought
every means to entangle him in a quarrel,” and did
not stop from robbing a ship belonging to the archbishop
and from seizing a number of horses, and
mutilating one of them. Thomas replied by excommunicating
Randulf and Robert de Broc, the
boldest of these offenders.</p>

<p>At Christmas more than one of the archbishop’s
followers warned him that his life was in danger,
and Thomas seems to have realised that his position
was hazardous. But he would not fly.</p>

<p>Already his murderers were at hand.</p>

<p>The excommunicated bishops had reached the
king at Bur, near Bayeux, had told their story, and
had coloured it with a fanciful description of Thomas
making a circuit of England at the head of a large
body of men.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Someone had said, “My lord, as
long as Thomas lives, you will have neither peace
nor quiet in your kingdom, nor will you ever see
good days;” and at this Henry had burst out into a
terrible rage of bitterness and passion, for such fits
at times took possession of him, “Here is a man,”
he cried out, “who came to my court a sorry clerk,
who owes all he has to me, and insults my kingdom
and lifts his heel against me. And not one of the
cowardly sluggish knaves, whom I feed and pay so
well, but suffers this, nor has the heart to avenge
me!”</p>

<p>The words were spoken, and four of the king’s
knights—Reginald FitzUrse, William of Tracy,
Hugh of Morville, and Richard the Breton—hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
what was said, and that Roger of York had declared
“as soon as Thomas is dead all this trouble will be
ended, and not before,” at once departed. They
sailed from different ports and met together at
Saltwood, the castle of the Brocs, on December 28th.
The following day they rode on to Canterbury,
taking with them twelve of Randulf’s men and
Hugh of Horsea, who was called the Evil Deacon.</p>

<p>The king, on finding the four knights had left the
court, gave orders to have them stopped, but it was
too late. They were then at Canterbury, and entering
the hospitable doors of the palace had made
direct for the archbishop’s private chamber.</p>

<p>It was four o’clock. Dinner had been at three,
and Thomas was sitting on his bed talking to John
of Salisbury, Edward Grim, and a few other friends.
When the knights entered, Thomas recognized
Reginald, William, and Hugh, for they had served
under him years before, and waited for them to
speak.</p>

<p>Reginald FitzUrse was the spokesman. He
declared they had come from the king, that Thomas
must take an oath of fealty to the newly-crowned
prince, and must absolve the excommunicated
bishops. Thomas answered that the bishops might
have been absolved on their willingness to obey the
judgments of the Church, and that the king had
sanctioned what had been done at their reconciliation.</p>

<p>Reginald denied there had been any reconciliation,
and swore that Thomas was imputing treachery to
the king in saying such a thing.</p>

<p>The archbishop pointed out that the reconciliation
had taken place in public, and that Reginald himself
had been present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>Reginald swore he had never been there, and had
not heard of it. And at this the other knights
broke in, swearing again and again, by God’s
wounds, that they had borne with him far too long
already.</p>

<p>Then Thomas reminded them of the insults and
losses he had endured, especially at the hands of the
De Brocs, since his return.</p>

<p>Hugh of Morville answered him that he had his
remedy in the King’s Courts, and ought not to excommunicate
men on his own authority.</p>

<p>“I shall wait for no man’s leave to do justice on
any that wrong the Church and will not give satisfaction,”
Thomas replied.</p>

<p>“What do you threaten us! Threats are too
much!” cried Reginald FitzUrse.</p>

<p>Then the knights bit their gloves and angrily
defied the archbishop.</p>

<p>Thomas told them that they could not intimidate
him. “Once I went away like a timid priest; now
I have returned, and I will never leave again. If I
may do my office in peace, it is well: if I may not,
God’s will be done.” Then he turned to remind
them they had once sworn fealty to him when he
was chancellor.</p>

<p>“We are the king’s men,” they shouted out, “and
owe fealty to no one against the king!”</p>

<p>Bidding his servants keep the archbishop within
the precincts on peril of their lives, the knights
withdrew.</p>

<p>“It is easy to keep me,” said Thomas, “for I
shall not go away. I will not fly for the king or
for any living man.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not take counsel with us and give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
milder answer to your enemies?” said John of
Salisbury. “You are ready to die, but we are not.
Think of our peril!”</p>

<p>“We must all die,” the archbishop answered,
“and the fear of death must not turn us from doing
justice.”</p>

<p>Word was quickly brought in that the knights
were putting on their armour in the courtyard, and
the monks, frightened at the sight of these men with
drawn swords entering the orchard to the west of
the cathedral, rushed to the archbishop and implored
him to fly to the cathedral. Thomas smiled at their
terror, saying, “All you monks are too cowardly, it
seems to me.” And not till vespers had begun
would he leave for the minster. The knights broke
into the cloisters after him, and reaching St. Benet’s
chapel began to hammer at the door, which for safety
the monks had barred behind them.</p>

<p>Thomas at once ordered the door to be unbolted,
saying, “God’s house shall not be made a fortress on
my account.” He slipped back the iron bar himself,
and the angry knights rushed in with cries of
“Where is the traitor? Where is the archbishop?”</p>

<p>It was five o’clock and a dark winter’s night. Had
Thomas chosen, he could easily have escaped death
by concealing himself in the crypt or in one of the
many hiding places in the cathedral. But he felt his
hour had come and met it without faltering. John
of Salisbury and the rest of the monks and clerks
vanished away and hid themselves, leaving only
Edward Grim, Robert of Merton and William FitzStephen
with the archbishop. Soon only Grim was
left, when the archbishop came out boldly, and
standing by a great pillar near the altar of St. Benedict,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
answered his accusers. “Here I am: no
traitor, Reginald, but your archbishop.”</p>

<p>They tried to drag him from the church, but he
clung to the great pillar, with Edward Grim by his
side. For the last time Reginald called on him to
come out of the church. “I am ready to die, but
let my people go, and do not hurt them,” was the
archbishop’s answer. William Tracy seized hold of
him, but Thomas hurled him back. Upon that
FitzUrse shouted, “Strike! strike!” And Tracy
cut savagely at the head of the archbishop. Grim
sprang forward and the blow fell on his arm, and he
fell back badly wounded.</p>

<p>Then Thomas commended his cause and that of
the Church to St. Denis and the patron saints of the
cathedral, and his soul to God, and without flinching
bowed his head to his murderers. FitzUrse, Tracy
and Richard the Breton struck the archbishop down,
and Hugh the Evil Deacon mangled in brutal
fashion the head of St. Thomas before calling out to
the others: “Let us go now; he will never rise
again!”</p>

<p>Then they all rushed from the church, and shouting,
“King’s knights! King’s knights!” proceeded
to plunder the palace. They fled north that
night to the castle of Hugh of Morville at Knaresborough,
where for a time they lived in close
retirement. Tracy subsequently went on a pilgrimage
to Rome and Palestine, but all four “within
two years of the murder were living at court on
familiar terms with the king.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Henry and all his court were horrified when the
news was brought of the archbishop’s martyrdom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
for all the people proclaimed the murdered prelate a
saint and a martyr, and “a martyr he clearly was,
not merely to the privileges of the Church or to the
rights of the see of Canterbury, but to the general
cause of law and order as opposed to violence.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
Had St. Thomas yielded in the matter of the excommunicated
bishops, and sought favour with the
king at the expense of the liberties and discipline of
the Church, and had he given way to the savage,
lawless turbulence of the king’s knights, he would
not only have escaped a violent death, but might
have lived long in the sunshine of the royal pleasure.
He chose the rougher, steeper road, daring all to
save the Church and the mass of the English people
from being brought under the iron heel of a king’s
absolute rule, and he paid the penalty, pouring out
his blood on the stones of the minster at Canterbury
to seal the vows he had taken when he first entered
the city as archbishop.</p>

<p>In his dying St. Thomas was even stronger than
in his life. Henry hastened to beg the forgiveness
of Rome for his rash words that had provoked the
murder, and in the presence of the pope’s legates
in Normandy promised to give up the Constitutions
of Clarendon and to stand by the papacy against the
emperor. Nor did he make any further attempt in
his reign to bring the Church under the subjection
of the crown, but built up a great system of legal
administration, which in substance exists to-day.</p>

<p>St. Thomas was canonised four years after his
death. “There was no shadow of doubt in men’s
minds that here was one who was a martyr as fully
as any martyr of the catacombs and the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
persecutions.” (R. H. Benson, <cite>St. Thomas of Canterbury</cite>.)
Countless miracles were alleged to prove
the sanctity of the dead hero, and pilgrims from all
parts made their way to the shrine of the “blessful
martyr” at Canterbury. Not only in England, but
in France and Flanders, and particularly in Ireland
was there an outburst of devotion to St. Thomas.</p>

<p>The shrine at Canterbury was destroyed by
Henry VIII., who after a mock trial of the archbishop
slain more than 300 years earlier, declared
that “Thomas, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury,
had been guilty of contumacy, treason and rebellion,”
and “was no saint, but rather a rebel and traitor to
his prince.”</p>

<p>But though Thomas, canonised by the pope on
the prayers of the people of England, could be struck
out of the calendar of the Church of England by the
arbitrary will of King Henry VIII., as an enemy of
princes, and his shrine destroyed, it is beyond the
power of a king to reverse the sentence of history or
to blast for ever the fame of a great and courageous
champion of the poor of this land. Time makes
little of the insults of Henry VIII. Thomas of
Canterbury died for the religion that in his day protected
the people against the despotism of the crown.
“He was always a hater of liars and slanderers and
a kind friend to dumb beasts (hence his rage with
De Broc for mutilating a horse) and all poor and
helpless folk.” (F. York Powell.)</p>

<p>That Henry II. strove to make law predominant
in the spirit of a great statesman is as true as that
Thomas strove to mitigate the harshness of the
law. As a writer of the twelfth century put it:
“Nothing is more certain than that both strove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
earnestly to do the will of God, one for the sake of
his realm, the other on behalf of his Church. But
whether of the two was zealous in wisdom is not
plain to man, who is so easily mistaken, but to the
Lord, who will judge between them at the last day.”</p>

<h3 class="left">WILLIAM FITZOSBERT<br />
CALLED LONGBEARD, THE<br />
FIRST ENGLISH AGITATOR
<span class="subhead">1196</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">When</span> Richard I., on his accession,
picked out Hubert Walter, Bishop of
Salisbury, to be Archbishop of Canterbury,
he chose a prelate whom he could
rely upon as his representative. Hubert had been a
crusader; he was the nephew of Ralph Glanville—who
sold the justiciarship to William Longchamp,
Bishop of Ely, for £3,000, and followed Richard to
Palestine, dying of the plague at Acre in 1191—and
though a man of little learning he was a capital
lawyer, a strong administrator and expert at raising
money for the king.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Hubert was no champion of
the poor as St. Thomas had been, no preacher of
righteousness like St. Anselm, no stickler for the
rights of the Church or the liberties of the people;
he was “the king’s man,” and “forasmuch as he was
neither gifted with a knowledge of letters nor endued
with the grace of lively religion, so in his days the
Church of England was stifled under the yoke of
bondage.” (Geraldus Cambrensis.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>Richard Cœur de Lion, occupied with the crusades,
had no mind for the personal government of
England. He depended on his ministers for money
to pay for his military expeditions to Palestine.
England was to him nothing more than a subject
province to be bled by taxation. Both William
Longchamp and Hubert Walter—to whom Richard
committed the realm when he left England for good
in 1194—did all that could be done to meet the
king’s demands. Government offices, earldoms and
bishoprics were sold to the highest bidder.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Judges
bought their seats on the bench and cities bought
their charters. Crown lands already granted to
tenants were again taken up by the king’s authority,
and the occupier compelled to pay for readmission
to his holding. Tournaments were revived, because
everyone taking part was obliged to take a royal
license. Even the great seal was broken by the
justiciar’s authority, and all documents signed by it
had to be reissued, with the payment of the usual
fees (or stamp duties) for new contracts. “By these
and similar inquisitions England was reduced to
poverty from one sea to the other,” for more than
£1,000,000 was sent to Richard by Hubert in the
first two years of his justiciarship.</p>

<p>The only protest against the general distress
came from London, and not from the aldermen or
burghers, but from the voteless labouring people
upon whom the whole burden of raising the city’s
taxes had been thrown. Against this monstrous
injustice William Longbeard FitzOsbert stood out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
as the spokesman of the poor of London, and died a
martyr for their cause.</p>

<p>London’s political importance had been seen in
the struggles against King Cnut and William the
Conqueror. Its remarkable influence in national
politics (an influence that endured to the middle
of the nineteenth century) was manifest when
London acclaimed Stephen as King of England in
1135. At the close of the twelfth century, London,
with the civic charter it had just obtained from
Richard, with its thirteen convent churches and more
than a hundred parish churches within its boundaries,
with its great cattle market at Smithfield and its
growing riverside trade, was already prosperous and
overcrowded. “The city was blessed with the healthiness
of the air and the nature of its site, in the
Christian religion, in the strength of its towers, the
honour of its citizens and the purity of its women;
it was happy in its sports and fruitful of high spirited
men.” It had its darker side, but at that time “the
only plagues were the intemperate drinking of foolish
people and the frequent fires.”</p>

<p>Richard’s charter left to the citizens the business
of assessing their own taxes, and in 1196 there was
trouble over this matter; for in that year the city
fathers decided that the large sums required by
Archbishop Hubert for the king’s needs should be
paid in full by the poorer craftsmen and labourers,
who had no say in the matter.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>“And when the aldermen assembled according to
usage in full hustings for the purpose of assessing
the taxes, the rulers endeavoured to spare their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
purses and to levy the whole from the poor.” (Roger
of Hoveden.)</p>

<p>Whereupon up rose William Longbeard, the son
of Osbert, and made his memorable protest against
these rascally proceedings, to go down to history as
the first popular agitator in England.</p>

<p>An exceptional man was this Longbeard, a man
of commanding stature and great strength, ready
witted, something of an orator and a lawyer, who
“burning with zeal for righteousness and fair play
made himself the champion of the poor,” holding that
every man, rich or poor, should pay his share of the
city’s burdens according to his means.</p>

<p>Longbeard was not of the labouring people himself.
He was a member of the city council, though
by no means a rich man. He had distinguished
himself as a crusader in 1190, making the journey to
Portugal against the Moors; and a vision of St.
Thomas Becket had appeared to him and his fellow
Londoners when their ship was beset by storms off
the coast of Spain.</p>

<p>Longbeard was known to the king, and he was
already hateful to the ruling class because he had
declared that Richard was being defrauded by financial
corruption of the money raised for the crown.
He had also accused his brother of treason in 1194,
but the case was not proved.</p>

<p>Richard was in Normandy in 1196, and Longbeard
having banded together 15,000 men in London,
under an oath that they would stick by him and
each other, went to the king and laid their grievances
before him. Richard heard the appeal sympathetically
enough, for after all, as long as the money was
forthcoming, he had no particular desire that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
pockets of rich burghers should be spared at the
expense of the poor, but left matters in the hands of
Archbishop Hubert the justiciar. Longbeard returned
to London, and with his 15,000<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> workmen in
revolt, bid an open defiance to the justiciar.</p>

<p>Only a fragment of one of Longbeard’s speeches
has been preserved, a solitary specimen of popular
oratory in the twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Taking a passage from the prophet Isaiah for his
text: “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
from the wells of the Saviour” (Isaiah xii, 3), the
agitator delivers his message.</p>

<p>“I am,” he saith, “the saviour of the poor. You
the poor, who have endured the hard hands of the
rich, draw ye from my wells the waters of sound
doctrine, and this with joy, for the time of your
visitation is at hand. For I will divide the waters
from the waters, and the People are the waters. I
will divide the humble and faithful from such as are
proud and froward. I will divide the just from the
unjust, even as light from darkness.”</p>

<p>For a time Longbeard was too strong for the
justiciar. Archbishop Hubert had no force at his
disposal for the invasion of London, for a battle
with Longbeard and his league.</p>

<p>At a great gathering of citizens, held in St. Paul’s
Churchyard, the justiciar’s men sent to arrest Longbeard
had been driven out of the city with violence.
All that Hubert could do was to give orders for the
arrest of any lesser citizens found outside London,
and two small traders from the city actually were
taken into custody at the town of Stamford on Mid-Lent
Sunday, 1196, under this authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>But the aldermen grew more and more frightened
at Longbeard’s bold speeches and his big public
meetings, and weakness and cowardice began to
demoralise the league. The people, who had
risen for “liberty and freedom,” fell away from
their leader, and FitzOsbert was left with a
comparatively small band to face the anger of the
justiciar.</p>

<p>Backed up by the city fathers, Hubert’s officers
again attempted to seize the agitator. Longbeard,
hardly pressed, snatched an axe from one of his assailants—a
citizen named Godfrey—and slew him; and
then retreated, overwhelmed by numbers, to take
refuge in the church of St. Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside.
There was a right of sanctuary in this
church, a right not to be denied to the commonest
felon.</p>

<p>But what were rights of sanctuary to the justiciar—bent
on hunting his prey to the death? He commanded
Longbeard “to come out and abide by the
law,” and gave orders to his men that, failing instant
obedience, he was to be dragged out.</p>

<p>Longbeard’s answer was to climb up into the
church tower, and thereupon Hubert ordered the
tower to be set on fire, and this was done. And
now the only chance of life for William Longbeard
and his followers was to cut their way through
the host of their enemies and make a bold rush
for safety. It was a remote chance at the best,
but sooner that than to perish in the burning
tower.</p>

<p>At the very church door Longbeard was struck
down—some say by Godfrey’s son—and his little
company were quickly slain or taken prisoners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Loaded with chains, the once bold advocate of the
poor of London, now badly hurt, was at once haled
off to the Tower. Sentence was pronounced without
delay of the law, William, the son of Osbert,
was to be dragged to the elms at Tyburn and there
hanged in chains.</p>

<p>A few days later—it was just before Easter—the
wounded man was stripped naked, tried to the tail
of a horse and dragged over the rough stones of the
streets of London. He was dead before Tyburn
was reached, but the poor broken body, on whom
the full vengeance of the rich and mighty had been
wreaked, was strung up in chains beneath the
gallows elm all the same. Bravely had Longbeard
withstood the rulers of the land in the day of his
strength; now, when life had passed from him, his
body was swinging in common contempt. And
with him were nine of his followers hanged.</p>

<p>So died William, called Longbeard, son of Osbert,
“for asserting the truth and maintaining the cause
of the poor.” And since it is held that to be faithful
to such a cause makes a man a martyr, people
thought he deserved to be ranked with the martyrs.
For a time multitudes—the very folk who had
fallen away from their champion in the hour of
battle and need—flocked to pay reverence to the
ghastly, bloodstained corpse that hung at Tyburn,
and pieces of the gibbet and of the bloodstained
earth beneath were carried off and counted as sacred
relics. All the great, heroic qualities of the man
were recalled. He was accounted a saint. Miracles
were alleged to take place when his relics were
touched.</p>

<p>Then the dead man’s enemies were aroused, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
alleged death-bed confession was published, wherein
Longbeard was made out to be a sorry criminal.
Not the least of the offences laid to his charge
was that a woman, who was not his wife, had stood
faithfully by the rebel, even when the church was on
fire.</p>

<p>The times were rough. It is probable that Longbeard,
crusader and fighting man, had sins enough
to confess before death took him. But his traducers
were silent as to these sins in the man’s lifetime.
They waited until no answer could be given before
uttering their miserable libels against the one
courageous champion of the poor.</p>

<p>Longbeard had roused the common working
people to make a stand against obvious oppression
and injustice—there was the head and front of his
offending, there was his crime; earning for him not
only a felon’s death, but the loss of character, and
the branding for all time with the contemptuous
title “Demagogue.”</p>

<p>Yet in the slow building up of English liberties
William FitzOsbert played his part, and laid down
his life in the age-long struggle for freedom, as many
a better has done.</p>

<p>In 1198, two years after the death of Longbeard,
Hubert was compelled to resign the justiciarship.
His monks at Canterbury, to whom the Church of
St. Mary, in Cheapside, belonged, and who had no
love for their archbishop,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> indignant at the violation
of sanctuary and the burning of their church,
appealed to the king and to the pope, Innocent III.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
to make Hubert give up his political activities and
confine himself to the work of an archbishop. In
the same year a great council of the nation, led by
St. Hugh of Lincoln, flatly refused a royal demand
for money made by Hubert.</p>

<p>Innocent III. was against him, the great barons
were against him, and Hubert resigned. But he
held the archbishopric till 1205.</p>

<h3 class="left">STEPHEN LANGTON AND<br />
THE GREAT CHARTER
<span class="subhead">1207–1228</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">When</span> Hubert Walter, Archbishop of
Canterbury—the old Justiciar of
Richard I.—ended his long life of
public service on July 12th, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1205,
King John exclaimed, with frank satisfaction, “Now
for the first time I am King of England!” As
long as Hubert was alive there was one man strong
enough to restrain the king, and the primate and
William the Marshall together had done something
to guard England against the foulest and most
ruthless tyranny of all its kings. To the end
William the Marshall was a brave and patriotic
statesman, but he served the crown rather than the
people.</p>

<p>On Hubert’s death John meant to have for archbishop
a creature of his will, and he was defeated by
Pope Innocent III., who, dismissing the appeal of
the monks of Canterbury for Reginald, their subprior,
and John’s appeal for his nominee, John de
Gray, Bishop of Norwich, proposed the English-born
Cardinal, Stephen Langton, “than whom there
was no man greater in the Roman court, nor was
there any equal to him in character and in learning.”
The monks consented to Stephen’s appointment,
but John’s reply was a flat refusal, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
on June 7th, 1207, Pope Innocent proceeded to
consecrate Stephen Langton Archbishop of Canterbury,
the king’s rage broke out. Innocent’s wise
judgment gave England one of its noblest and
greatest archbishops, and the service wrought by
Langton for the liberties of England’s people was
of deep and lasting value. But the immediate price
to be paid for later profit was heavy.</p>

<p>John met Langton’s consecration by seizing the
estates of Canterbury, driving the chapter into exile,
and proclaiming that anyone who acknowledged
Stephen as archbishop should be accounted a public
enemy. The remonstrances and warnings of the
pope were disregarded, and in March, 1208, all
England was laid under an interdict, and there was
an end to the public ministrations of religion in the
country for six years—to the bitter distress of the
common people.</p>

<p>Immediately the interdict came into force, John
declared all the property of the clergy, secular or
monastic, to be confiscated, and there was no one
to stay his hand from speedy spoliation. For the
barons were willing enough to see the clergy robbed
and the king’s treasury filled at the expense of the
Church, and of the bishops only two were left in
England—Peter des Roches, of Winchester, and
John de Gray, of Norwich—and both these were
willing tools of the king. Never did John enjoy his
royal will and pleasure with such unhindered ferocity
as in that year 1209. Had the barons stood by the
Church they might have saved England unspeakable
miseries, and as it was the laity were soon in as
sorry a plight as the clergy, “and it seemed as
though the king was courting the hatred of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
class of his subjects, so burdensome was he to both
rich and poor.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>In 1211 came Pandulf from Pope Innocent with
suggestions for peace. Let the king restore the
property of the clergy, and receive Archbishop
Langton, with his kinsmen and friends, and the
other exiled bishops “fairly and in peace” and the
interdict should be withdrawn. John declined to
receive Langton as archbishop, and Pandulf, in the
presence of the whole council, pronounced the papal
sentence of excommunication on the king, absolving
all his subjects from allegiance, and commanding
their obedience to whomsoever should be sent as
John’s successor.</p>

<p>John treated the excommunication with cheerful
contempt, and pursued the evil tenour of his way.
But his position was precarious, for the barons—especially
the northern barons—were plotting his
overthrow, and the pope had decided that Philip of
France should depose John and reign in his stead.
John was driven to capitulate to the pope at the end
of 1212, and in May, 1213, Pandulf arrived, and
the invasion by Philip was stopped, to the exceeding
annoyance of the French king.</p>

<p>John met the papal legate at Ewell, near Dover,
and in the presence of “the great men of the
realm,” swore to carry out all Innocent’s demands,
promising that Stephen should be received and
recompense paid to the clergy for their losses.
Then the King of England formally surrendered
“to God and to the Holy Mother Church of Rome,
and to Pope Innocent and his Catholic successors,”
the whole realm of England and Ireland, “with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
rights thereunto appertaining, to receive them back
and hold them thenceforth as a feudatory of God
and the Roman Church.” He swore fealty to the
pope for both realms, and added that he would send
a yearly tribute of 1,000 marks. At the same time
John declared that the act of homage was voluntary,
done, “not at the driving of force nor the compulsion
of fear, but of our own good free will and by
the common counsel of our barons.”</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the pope asked for this
abject submission, but there are good reasons why
John desired that political protection of the papacy
which he obtained by the act of homage.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> (Matthew
Paris has a story that John was willing to pay
homage and tribute to the Mohammedan Emir of
Morocco in order to effect an alliance with some
foreign power.)</p>

<p>The barons themselves appealed to the pope two
years later to take their part against John, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
ground that it was only by their compulsion the king
had been brought to pay homage to Rome, and
though they were then to curse the papal overlordship
they had helped procure, and England was to
come to regard John’s surrender to the pope as
“a thing to be detested for all time,” in that year 1213
the protection of the pope was invaluable to John
and, as some thought, to the country. “For matters
were in such a strait, and so great was the fear on
all sides, that there was no more ready way of avoiding
the imminent peril—perhaps no other way at all.
For when once he had put himself under apostolical
protection and made his realms a part of the patrimony
of St. Peter, there was not in the Roman
world a sovereign who durst attack him or would
invade his lands, in such awe was Pope Innocent
held above all his predecessors for many years
past.” (Walter of Coventry.)</p>

<p>The long war being at an end Stephen Langton
and four of the exiled bishops landed in June, and
Stephen was now to do the work of archbishop, the
work he had been solemnly consecrated to six years
before.</p>

<p>John met the primate at Winchester, and swore
on the gospels in the cathedral “that he would
cherish, defend and maintain the holy Church and
her ordained ministers; that he would restore the
good laws of his forefathers, especially St. Edward’s,
rendering to all men their rights; and that before
the next Easter he would make full restitution of all
property which had been taken away in connection
with the interdict.” Then Stephen formally absolved
the king from excommunication and gave him the
kiss of peace, to the general rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>And now England was to see what sort of archbishop
it was Pope Innocent had sent to Canterbury.
With a king as cruel as he was vigorous, and as
astute as he was unscrupulous, with barons who
knew neither loyalty nor patriotism. Archbishop
Stephen, out of such materials, was to win for his
native land the Great Charter, and to have it written
in black and white that all who would might read
the several duties of king and people. In August
Langton, in St. Paul’s Cathedral, read to the barons
the old coronation charter of Henry I., and reminded
them that the liberties promised in that document
were to be recovered. “With very great joy the
barons swore they would fight for these liberties,
even unto death if it were needful, and the archbishop
promised that he would help with all his
might.” Thus within three months of his setting
foot in England Langton had started the movement
for the Great Charter.</p>

<p>But not with king and barons only had the archbishop
to deal. There were endless difficulties with
the clergy concerning the restitution of their property,
and the payment of compensation to be
settled. And above all there was Nicholas, the
papal legate, in England, usurping the primate’s
functions, filling up vacant bishoprics and churches,
regardless of the rights of the Church and of the
archbishop. Nicholas was recalled to Rome when
the interdict was finally removed, and in November,
1214, John made a public proclamation that free
and undisturbed election to all the churches in his
realm should be allowed henceforth. This was an
attempt on the king’s part to have the Church on
his side against the barons, for the battle was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
beginning between John and the barons which was
to be fought to a bitter end.</p>

<p>John’s last campaign to recover the lost Angevine
provinces for the English crown ended in disaster,
and he returned to England in 1214 to face the full
discontent of the barons whom he had harassed and
insulted from the day he came to the throne, and of
a country suffering from “the evil customs which
the king’s father and brother had raised up for the
oppression of the Church and realm, together with
the abuses which the king himself had added
thereto.”</p>

<p>The national grievances were enormous and
intolerable. The whole administration of justice
was corrupt, and no one could be sure how the
arbitrary decisions of the king’s officers would be
carried out. Liberty of the person was a farce when
free men could be arrested, evicted from their lands,
exiled and outlawed without legal warrant or a fair
trial. “In a word, the entire system of government
and administration set up under the Norman kings,
and developed under Henry and Richard, had been
converted by the ingenuity of John into a most
subtle and effective engine of royal extortion, oppression
and tyranny over all classes of the nation, from
earl to villein.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Here and there the barons had struck against
some act of personal injury, and the northern barons
had been conspicuous in their resentment, refusing
to follow John as their liege lord in his expeditions to
France. But there was neither cohesion nor any sense
of national injury amongst the barons until Stephen
Langton, with a full sense of the responsibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
laid on the successor of Lanfranc and Anselm,
of Theobald and Thomas, took the lead, and by
strong, courageous effort sought to end for all time
in England such tyranny as the country had endured
under John’s rule. To Langton this was no mere
struggle between a despotic king and a set of turbulent
nobles. It was a struggle to win recognition of
law for <em>all</em> men, and to restore some measure of
justice and the enjoyment of fair liberty throughout
the land. The people had neither spokesman nor
champion, and no man heeded their wrongs save
Langton. More than 150 years were to pass before
John Ball and Wat Tyler would appear at the head
of a peasant army in revolt. In the reign of John,
yeomen, peasant and artizan were dumb. It was
Langton who saw that the barons fighting for their
own rights could be made to fight for all England.</p>

<p>In November the barons came together at St.
Edmundsbury, and in the abbey church “they swore
on the high altar that if the king sought to evade
their demand for the laws and liberties of the charter
of King Henry I., they would make war upon him
and withdraw from fealty to him till he should by a
charter furnished with his seal confirm to them all
that they demanded. They also agreed that after
Christmas they would go all together to the king
and ask him for a confirmation of these liberties, and
that meanwhile they would so provide themselves
with horses and arms that if the king should seek to
break his oath, they might, by seizing his castles,
compel him to make satisfaction. And when these
things were done every man returned to his own
home.” (Roger of Wendover.)</p>

<p>John kept Christmas at Worcester, but his court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
was very small, and he realised that he stood
alone. All through the years of the interdict the
pope’s ban had not kept the nobles from attendance
on the king; it was now when he stood reconciled
to the Church that John found himself deserted.
He moved to London at the new year, and there on
the Epiphany came the confederate barons, making
display of arms, and praying that the laws and
liberties of Edward the Confessor written in the
charter of Henry I. might be confirmed. John
urged that the question was too big and too difficult
to be settled off hand, and asked that it should be
put off till Easter. This was agreed to on condition
that the king pledged himself by three sureties to
fulfil his promises. Archbishop Stephen, William
the Marshall and the Bishop of Ely were accepted
as sureties, and in accepting the post Langton
proved his great statesmanship. There was no
question of going over to the king’s side. The
barons knew the archbishop as their chief ally, but
John knew that Langton was to be trusted as implicitly
as he trusted William the Marshall. Langton’s
one desire was to see the written enactment
granting constitutional liberties, and ending the
worst of the royal abuses.</p>

<p>John did not waste the time allotted to him, but
worked his hardest to gain friends and supporters
against the barons, and to break up the confederacy.
It was all to no purpose. His commissioners to the
County Courts—in the southern and midland shires,
sent to explain the king’s cause—met with no
success. Nobles and churchmen alike stood aloof,
and all John could do was to write to the knights at
Poitou to send him mercenaries, and to appeal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
his liege lord, the pope, against his rebellious
subjects. Finally, he took the cross, hoping for
the favours awarded to a crusader. These efforts
were all of no avail. The mercenaries were inadequate.
The pope’s letters of rebuke to the barons
for their conspiracies and conjurations were unheeded,
and at Easter, John (whom the pope had
warned to harken to “just petitions”) was driven to
send the primate and the Marshall for a definite
statement of the laws and liberties demanded.</p>

<p>The barons, who were assembled at Brackley,
presented “a certain schedule,” probably compiled
with Langton’s assistance, and this was read to the
king by the primate. “They might as well ask for
my kingdom at once,” was John’s reply to the
various items, and he swore he would never grant
liberties that would mean his own enslavement.
Both Langton and the Marshall strove to persuade
the king to yield, but to no purpose; and all that
remained was to return to the barons and to state
that the king refused their demands. Then the
barons, on hearing this, flew to arms, formally
renounced their homage and fealty to the king, and
chose a military leader for themselves—Robert
Fitz-Walter. London welcomed the insurgents on
May 24th, and John, with a handful of mercenaries,
had the whole baronage against him. Capitulation
was inevitable. From Windsor John sent
envoys to the barons in London, promising, for the
sake of peace and for the welfare and honour of his
realm, to concede the laws and liberties demanded,
and advising the appointment of time and place for
a meeting for “the settlement of all these things.”
The barons at once fixed the meeting for June 15th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
in a meadow called Runnymead, between Staines
and Windsor, and there, in the presence of well-nigh
all the baronage of England, of Archbishop
Stephen, and seven bishops, and “a multitude of
most illustrious knights,” the Great Charter was
signed. It was the work of Langton.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> It was he
who had inspired the movement, had framed the
articles, and had brought the struggle to a successful
issue.</p>

<p>“One copy of the Great Charter still remains in
the British Museum, injured by age and fire, but
with the royal seal still hanging from the brown,
shrivelled parchment. It is impossible to gaze without
reverence on the earliest monument of English
freedom which we can see with our own eyes and
touch with our own hands, the Great Charter to
which from age to age patriots have looked back as
the basis of English liberty.” (J. R. Green.)</p>

<p>Yet the Charter itself was in the main but the
old charter of Henry I. writ large. It set up no
new rights and conferred no new privileges. It
sanctioned no constitutional changes, and proclaimed
no new liberties. Its real importance is in the fact
that it was a <em>written</em> document—“this great table
of laws, won by the people of England from a
tyrannous king, was the first great act which laid
down in black and white the main points of the
constitution and the several rights and duties of
king and people.” (F. York Powell.)</p>

<p>“The bonds of unwritten custom, which the older
grants did little more than recognize, had proved too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
weak to hold Angevins; and the baronage now threw
them aside for the restraints of written law. It is in
this way that the Great Charter marks the transition
from the age of traditional rights, preserved in the
nation’s memory and officially declared by the
primate, to the age of written legislation, of parliaments
and statutes, which was soon to come.” (J. R.
Green.)</p>

<p>The first article of the Charter guaranteed the
freedom of the English Church, and, in especial, the
freedom of elections, “which was reputed most
requisite.”</p>

<p>By the Great Charter the feudal rights of the
king over his vassals were defined and settled,
and the tenants of the barons were protected
in similar way from the lawless exactions of their
lords.</p>

<p>No scutage or aid was to be levied by the crown,
“save by the common council of the realm”—except
the three customary feudal aids for the ransoming
of the king, the knighting of his eldest son, and the
marriage of his eldest daughter. This common
council, consisting of bishops, abbots, earls, and
greater barons, was to be summoned by special writ.
The free rights of London and the other chartered
towns were fully admitted.</p>

<p>The Court of Common Pleas (cases between
subjects) was to sit at Westminster (and not to
follow the king in his wanderings), and judges of
assize were to go on circuit four times a year.</p>

<p>No free man was to be seized, imprisoned, ousted
of his land, outlawed, banished, or in any way
brought to ruin, save by the legal judgment of his
peers or by the law of the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>To no man was justice to be sold, denied, or postponed
by the king.</p>

<p>The free right of Englishmen and foreigners to
pass in and out of the country in time of peace was
granted.</p>

<p>The king’s mercenaries, “all the gang that came
with horses and arms to the hurt of the realm,” were
to be sent out of England.</p>

<p>Finally, by a supplementary document, the barons
present at Runnymead were to choose out of the
whole baronage twenty-five sworn guardians of the
Charter, who, in the event of any violation of its
articles, were not to hesitate from making war on
the king till the matter had been put right.</p>

<p>Well might John exclaim, in a wild burst of rage,
when the Charter was signed, and he was alone with
his foreign troops, “They have given me five-and-twenty
over-kings!”</p>

<p>The twenty-five were to ensure the king’s obedience
to the Charter, but who was to ensure the obedience
of the twenty-five?—all of whom were of the
party of revolt against the king. A safeguard was
obviously necessary, and a second court of barons,
thirty-eight in number, was chosen—(which included
William the Marshall)—and these first swore
obedience to the twenty-five, and then a second
oath to enforce on king and barons mutual
respect.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>The Great Charter was signed, and within a week
it was published throughout all England. But the
“sort of peace” patched up between John and
the barons was not to last. None of the barons
believed that the king would abide by the oaths he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
had sworn, and they, for their part, prepared for
war.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>To the Continent John looked for aid, “seeking
to be revenged upon his enemies by two swords,
the sword of the spirit and the sword of the flesh,
so that if one failed he could count upon the other
for success.” He had appealed to the pope in May,
and Innocent’s reply had been a general condemnation
of all disturbers of the peace. Pandulf, the
papal legate, was at Runnymead, and in August,
when the barons were openly making ready for
hostilities, he and Peter des Roches, of Winchester,
called on Stephen Langton to enforce the papal
sentence of excommunication against certain of the
barons. Langton, who was about to set out to
Rome for a general council, declined to do this until
he had seen the pope and discussed the whole
question with him. He believed the sentence had
been drawn up by the pope under a misunderstanding.
Thereupon Pandulf and Peter des Roches, by
virtue of their authority, declared Stephen disobedient
to the papal mandate, and pronounced his
suspension from his office of archbishop.</p>

<p>Langton made no protest against the sentence but
went to Rome, and was present at the general
council in November. His chiefest work for England
was done when the Charter was signed at Runnymead.
With the king and the barons at civil war,
the country ravaged by John’s foreign bands of
merciless savages, and the barons praying Louis, the
son of Philip of France, to take the English crown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
what could Archbishop Stephen accomplish? Pope
Innocent had declared the Charter annulled on the
ground that both king and barons had made the
pope the over-lord of England, and that in consequence
nothing in the government and constitution
of the country could be altered without his knowledge
and sanction. But as the legate, the primate,
and the bishops had all left for Rome, the pope’s
disallowing of the Charter never got published in
England at all, though it was known that he had
sent letters.</p>

<p>The sentence of suspension was removed from
Langton in February, 1216. A few months later
the great pope, Innocent III., passed away, and in
October John was dead.</p>

<p>In 1217 Stephen Langton was back again at
Canterbury, to remain for eleven more years the
primate of England. With William the Marshall
and Hubert de Burgh, Stephen worked for the preservation
of public peace during those early years of
Henry III. We find him in 1223 demanding a fresh
confirmation of the Charter in the council at Oxford,
and two years later its solemn proclamation is
required by the archbishop and the barons as the
price of a new subsidy. Equally resolute is Archbishop
Stephen for public order, threatening with
all the pains and penalties of excommunication the
barons, who (in spite of Hubert de Burgh’s letters
from the pope declaring Henry to be of age) were
anxious to keep the royal castles in their own hands.
“At a time when constitutional freedom was hardly
known, when insurrection seemed the only possible
means of checking despotism, he (Langton)
organized and established a movement for freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
which by every act and word of his life he showed
to be in opposition to mere anarchy.” (C. E.
Maurice.)</p>

<p>Stephen Langton was never canonized, though
application was made to Rome to that end shortly
after his death in 1228. His learning had made him
famous in Paris before Pope Innocent summoned
him to Rome to become cardinal priest of St.
Chrysogonus. His wise statesmanship was proved
by the victory he won for England’s liberties over
so energetic and ruthless a despot as John, and
with such material as the barons. His strength of
character and disinterested patriotism were impaired
by no taint of baseness or self seeking. If Stephen
Langton is not numbered with the saints, he ranks
high in the great list of England’s primates, serving
religion as faithfully as he served justice and social
order, and his name is resplendent for all time in the
charters of English liberty.</p>

<h3 class="left">BISHOP GROSSETESTE<br />
THE REFORMER
<span class="subhead">1235–1253</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> story of Robert Grosseteste’s bishophood
is the record of eighteen years’ unflinching
battle with abuses in Church
and State. From his enthronement as
Bishop of Lincoln in 1235 till his death in 1253
Grosseteste is conspicuous as a reformer. Now it is
the slackness of the clergy he is combatting, enforcing
discipline on men and women who, vowed
to religion, preferred an easier way of life. At
another time he is maintaining the laws and liberties
of the nation against Henry III., who with all his
piety knew neither honesty nor truth in his sovereignty.
Right on till the last year of his life
Grosseteste is as vigorous in resisting papal encroachments
on the English Church as he is in
dealing with his clergy or with the king. As a
reformer his work is threefold:—(1) The correction
of current abuses in the Church. (2) Maintenance
of justice under the misrule of Henry III. (3)
Resistance to the aggressive claims of the papacy.
With all this work, fighting enemies of England at
home and abroad, Grosseteste is busy administering
his enormous diocese of Lincoln—then the largest
in the country, including as it did the counties
of Lincoln, Leicester, Buckingham, Huntingdon,
Northampton, Oxford and Bedford (Oxford and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Peterborough were afterwards carved out of Lincoln)—and
is found writing to and advising all
manner of men, kings, nobles and peasants.</p>

<p>Here is the character of Bishop Grosseteste as
his contemporary, Matthew Paris, saw it, and
Matthew was a monk, and the champion of the
monks, and hated Grosseteste’s stern interference
with monastic <span class="locked">life:—</span></p>

<p>“He was an open confuter of both pope and
king, the corrector of monks, the director of priests,
the instructor of clerks, the support of scholars, a
preacher to the people, a persecutor of the incontinent,
the tireless student of the Scriptures, the
hammer and despiser of the Romans. At the table
of bodily refreshment he was hospitable, eloquent,
courteous, pleasant and affable. At the spiritual
table devout, tearful and contrite. In his episcopal
office he was sedulous, venerable and indefatigable.”</p>

<p>Six hundred years later the whirligig of time
leaves this verdict of old Matthew Paris unreversed,
and finds Grosseteste’s reputation enhanced.</p>

<p>“There is scarcely a character in English history
whose fame has been more constant, both during
and after his life, than Robert Grosseteste, Bishop
of Lincoln from 1235 to 1253. As we find his
advice sought universally during his lifetime, and
his example spoken of as that which almost all the
other prelates of his day followed, so was it also
after his death. If threats from Rome and excommunications
from Canterbury fell harmlessly upon
him while alive, his example nerved others in subsequent
years—as in the case of Sewal, Archbishop
of York—to bear even worse attacks without giving
way. And probably no one has had a greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
influence upon English thought and English literature
for the two centuries which followed his time; few
books will be found that do not contain some quotations
from Lincolniensis, ‘the great clerk, Grostest.’”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>A Suffolk man was Grosseteste, and born of
humble parents. Sent to Oxford by his friends he
becomes master of the schools and chancellor of the
university—the foremost scholar of his day—receives
various ecclesiastical preferments, and at the age of
sixty is freely elected by the chapter of Lincoln as
their bishop. If the canons of Lincoln believed
that Grosseteste’s age would ensure comparative
quiet for the diocese and a continuance of the loose
order of his immediate predecessors, they were
speedily undeceived.</p>

<p>Grosseteste brought into Lincoln an energy for
religion that disturbed the easy-going monks, with
their comfortable common-room life, and altogether
upset the secular clergy with their illegal marriages
and their parochial revellings. In the first year of
his authority Grosseteste’s letter to his archdeacons,
followed by his diocesan constitutions, shows the
hand of the reformer. He calls attention to the
neglect of the canonical hours of prayer—certain
clergy “fearing not God nor regarding man, either
do not say the canonical hours or say them in
mutilated fashion, and that without any sign of devotion,
or at an hour more suitable to their own
desires than convenient to their parishioners”—to
the private marriages of many priests, to the strife
and bloodshed and desecration caused by the miracle
plays in churchyards, and to the drunkenness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
gluttony attendant on funeral feasts. Grosseteste
also complains that the parochial clergy oppose the
preaching friars, “maliciously hindering the people
from hearing the sermons of the friars, and permitting
those to preach who make a trade of it, and
who only preach such things as may draw money.”
Incidentally, and with a curiously modern touch,
Grosseteste urges his archdeacons to warn mothers
and nurses against overlaying their children at night,
for it seems many infants were suffocated in this way.</p>

<p>Grosseteste relied on the friars, Franciscan and
Dominican, to revive religion in his diocese.
From their first coming to England he had befriended
the little brothers of St. Francis and St.
Dominic’s order of preachers, and at Oxford had
been conspicuously their rector. He writes to Pope
Gregory IX. in the highest praise of the Franciscans:
“Inestimable benefits have been wrought in my
diocese by the friars. They enlighten our whole
land with the bright light of their preaching and
learning.”</p>

<p>The secular clergy and the monks generally by
no means shared Grosseteste’s appreciation of the
preachers of poverty, and when the Bishop of Lincoln
began to rout up the monasteries in his diocese
with visitations and enquiries the dismay was
considerable. The Benedictine monks in England
were good, easy men in the thirteenth century—Grosseteste
finds no grave faults against morality to
rebuke in them—fond of their pleasant social life,
and enjoying the comfort of an existence that had
few temporal cares beyond finding money for pope
and king. At the worst their sloth was culpable.
Grosseteste charged upon them with his preaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
friars, calling for amendment and the fulfilment of
duties, attacking old abuses sanctioned by custom,
and showing no tolerant sympathy for the infirmities
and shortcomings of middle-aged clerks.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Respect
him they must, for the learning and high character
of the bishop were conspicuous in the land, but the
dislike of all this strenuous exhortation was not concealed.
The very chapter of Lincoln, which had
elected him bishop, refused to admit Grosseteste as
their visitor, or to acknowledge his jurisdiction over
their proceedings, and only after six years of controversy
and litigation was the case finally decided at
Rome (1245) wholly in the bishop’s favour. A sentence
of excommunication pronounced upon him by
the monks at Canterbury during the vacancy of the
see was of course entirely ignored by Grosseteste.
If the clergy resented Grosseteste’s call to arms, it is
to be remembered that they had suffered considerably
from the tyranny of the times, and had been
reduced under the general oppression to a feeble
and sluggish timidity. The old “Song of the
Church”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> tells how low they had fallen:</p>

<p>To check the rapacity of the king, and to stop
the seizure of Church revenues for Italian clerics,
and thereby to raise the English clergy from their
state of sluggish despondency was Grosseteste’s
work for England. We find him conspicuous at the
council summoned by the king to meet at Westminster
in 1244. In vain Henry III. appealed for
money, bishops and nobles reminded him that the
money so frequently granted had done no good
either to the king or the country, and that a justiciar
and chancellor must be appointed for the strengthening
of the state. Henry demurred, tried postponements
and delays, and these failing, summoned the
bishops alone, and confronted them with a letter
from Pope Innocent IV. exhorting them to give
liberally to the king. Even this failed to move the
prelates. After much discussion, however, some
were for “a mild answer,” for many of the prelates
“fearing the king’s instability and the pusillanimity
of the royal counsellors,” were unwilling to deny the
pope’s request. Grosseteste clinched the matter by
declaring they must all stand together with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
barons:<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> “We may not be divided from the
common counsel. For it is written if we be divided
we shall all perish forthwith,” The next day Henry
tried to get at each of the bishops separately—an
old device. “But they with wary heed would not be
so entrapped, and by departing early in the morning
escaped the net in which they had once been caught;
and so the council broke up to the king’s discontent.”
(Matthew Paris.)</p>

<p>Again in 1252 Henry summoned the bishops, and
tried to coerce them into giving him money by producing
a papal mandate, authorising the payment
of a full tithe of all Church revenues to the king for
the space of three years. To make matters worse,
“payment was not to be made on the old assessment,
but on a new assessment conducted with
strict inquiry, at the will and judgment of the royal
agents and extortioners, who would seek their own
profit before the king’s.” The excuse was that the
king was about to start on a pilgrimage. Grosseteste
was then an old man, but he blazed out at this
monstrous demand, especially when the king’s
messengers went on to explain that the tithe for two
years might be paid at once, and that the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
year’s tithe could also be raised before the king
actually started. “By our Lady,” said the sturdy
bishop of Lincoln, “what does all this mean? You
assume that we shall agree to this damnable levy,
and go on arguing from premises that have not been
admitted. God forbid that we should thus bend
our knee to Baal.”</p>

<p>The king’s half-brother, Ethelmar, bishop-elect of
Winchester, deprecated resistance to the will of
pope and king, and urged that the French had consented
to pay a similar demand. “Yes,” said the
Bishop of Ely, “and it brought their king no good.”
“For the very reason the French have yielded must
we resist,” replied Grosseteste. “To do a thing
twice makes it a custom, and if we pay too, we
shall have no peace. For my own part, I say plainly
that I will not pay this evil demand, lest the king
himself as well as us should incur the heavy wrath
of God.” The other bishops followed Grosseteste’s
lead, and the old man went on to advise them to
pray the king to think of his eternal salvation, and
to restrain his rash impulses. Henry naturally
declined to send an independent remonstrance to the
pope against the mandate, and the bishops decided
they could do nothing in the way of granting this
special tithe. But they were hard put to it, “between
the pulling of the king and the pushing of the pope.”</p>

<p>All Grosseteste’s dealings with the king show the
same firm resolution to stop the royal extortion, and
to insist on the fulfilment of the charters of liberties
obtained from the crown. He carries on the work
of Stephen Langton, always backing up the unsuccessful
efforts of the good St. Edmund Rich
(Archbishop of Canterbury, 1234–1240) to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Henry faithful to his word, and prepares the way for
the great campaign of his friend Simon of Montfort.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
The very worst period of Henry’s long
reign is covered by Grosseteste’s episcopal life.
Hubert de Burgh’s wise rule was over by 1232, and
Peter des Roches and the horde of aliens were
fleecing the country for the next twenty years. It
is not till after Grosseteste’s death that the barons
dealt with Henry’s misrule to any purpose.</p>

<p>At the great council held in London in 1248, at
which Grosseteste was present, a full list of the
national grievances is given: the lavish waste of the
wealth of the country on foreigners, the ruin of
trade by the arbitrary seizure of goods by the king
and his agents, the robbery of poor fishermen by
royal authority, “so that they think it safer to trust
themselves to the stormy waves and seek a further
shore,” and the keeping bishoprics and abbacies
vacant so that the crown may enjoy the revenues
therefrom, are the chief causes of complaint. They
were not new grievances, for the most part, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
were not to die with Henry III., all charters and
royal promises notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Added to the common wrongs of Henry’s wretched
misrule were the papal extortions, directly encouraged
by the king. In return for papal mandates directing
churchmen to supply the king with money, what
could Henry—himself the most devoted servant of
the papacy—do but help the pope to get what he
could out of England? The wealth of England
was held to be of fabulous amount at Rome, and
popes beset by fierce ungodly emperors naturally
turned to it in their need as to a treasury.</p>

<p>But the thing was intolerable to Grosseteste. He
had studied in Paris, he welcomed Dominican and
Franciscan friars from the continent as no other
prelate did, and had no objection to foreigners <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>.
But the pope claimed the revenues of church livings
for boys and presented illiterates to benefices—to
the obvious degradation of the Church in England.
Grosseteste was always willing enough to raise what
money he could for the holy see, but appoint unworthy
and incompetent clerks to livings in his
diocese, that he would not do—not for any pope.</p>

<p>The country groaned under the biting avarice of
the Roman see, as it bled under the vampire politics
of Peter des Roches and his needy, greedy crew of
Bretons and Poitevins.</p>

<p>What it all meant to England Matthew Paris has
told us in his description of things in 1237:</p>

<p>“Now was simony practised without shame and
usurers on various pleas openly extorted money from
the common people and lesser folk; charity expired,
the liberty of the Church withered away, religion
was trampled to the dust. Daily did illiterate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
persons of the lowest class, armed with bulls from
Rome, burst forth into threats; and, in spite of the
privileges handed down to us from good men of old,
they feared not to plunder the revenues consecrated
by our holy forefathers for the service of religion, the
support of the poor, and the nourishment of strangers,
but thundering out their excommunications they
quickly and violently carried off what they demanded.
And if those who were wronged and robbed sought
refuge by appealing or pleading their privileges, they
were at once suspended and excommunicated by a
papal writ. Thus mourning and lamentation were
heard on all sides, and many exclaimed with heart-rending
sobs, ‘It were better to die than to behold
the sufferings of our country and its saints. Woe to
England, once the chief of provinces, the mistress
of nations, the mirror of the Church, the exemplar
of religion, and now brought under tribute,—trampled
on by worthless men, and the prey of men
of low degree.’”</p>

<p>The arrival of Otho, in 1237, a papal legate (on
the request of Henry), far from remedying, increased
the contemporary distress. For though Otho was a
discreet man, he was more eager to get money for
Rome than to deal with the oppression that plagued
England, and when he did give advice it was spurned
by those who saw his grasping hands. Archbishop
Edmund was particularly vexed at having a papal
legate set over him, and what with one disappointment
and another finally gave up in despair the task
of guiding the English Church, and in 1240 went to
die at Pontigny, where his predecessors Anselm and
Thomas had lived in exile.</p>

<p>Grosseteste stuck to his post, and the Franciscans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
and Dominicans, whom he aided, poured in oil and
wine on the wounds of the Church folk, and revived
religion in the country.</p>

<p>Grosseteste fought the extortionate papal demands
for Church revenues all the time. In 1239, with
his fellow bishops, he tells Otho plainly that the
Church is drained dry by the grasping importunity
of Rome. Otho left in 1241, and that same year
saw Boniface of Savoy, a handsome, soldierly man
appointed to Canterbury as St. Edmund’s successor.
The following year came a new extortioner from
Rome, named Martin, an altogether inferior person
to Otho, but with all the legate’s powers of suspension
and excommunication. His confiscations and
rapacity provoked a remonstrance to the pope even
from Henry. Martin at last, in 1245, had to fly for
his life from England, and when Grosseteste subsequently
had a calculation made of the English
Church revenues enjoyed by foreigners, it was found
that the incomes of foreign clerks appointed by Pope
Innocent IV. amounted to more than 70,000 marks—more
than treble the king’s income. And all this
was done in spite of refusals by Grosseteste to
appoint illiterates or allow boys to hold benefices.</p>

<p>The barons sided with the Church against Martin,
and drew up a long protest which they sent to the
pope at the council of Lyons in 1245. In this they
complained:—That the pope, not content with
Peter’s Pence, which had been paid cheerfully from
old times, wrung money from the Church against
the law of the realm, without the king’s permission;
and that the pope wrongfully put ignorant, covetous,
or absentee Italians into English livings notwithstanding
his own promises, the rights of patrons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
and the privileges of the English clergy. A year
later the protest was repeated with another item
objecting to the pope’s claim to recall former
charters.</p>

<p>Innocent IV.’s answer to this was to threaten to
dethrone Henry as he had dethroned his brother-in-law,
the Emperor Frederick. The king weakly said
no more, the barons, without a leader, were equally
silent, and the Church continued “to sate the greed
of Rome.”</p>

<p>But in Grosseteste there was no spirit of surrender.
In 1253, the very last year of his life, he was called
upon by the pope to provide a nephew of his with a
canonry at Lincoln, and the bishop’s letter of refusal
is, perhaps, the only well remembered thing of all
Grosseteste’s writings. This letter was not, as
commonly stated, sent to the pope but to his representative
who was also named Innocent.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> “The
pope has power to build up,” wrote Grosseteste,
“but not to pull down. These appointments tend
to destruction, not edification, being of man’s device
and not according to the words of the Apostles or
the will of Christ. By my very love and obedience
to the Holy See I must refuse obedience in things
altogether opposed to the sanctity of the Apostolic
See and contrary to Catholic unity. As a son and
a servant I decline to obey, and this refusal must not
be taken as rebellion, for it is done in reverence to
divine commands.”</p>

<p>(This letter is quoted by Matthew Paris and in
the <cite>Burton Annals</cite>. It can be read in full in the
<cite>Epistles</cite>, No. 128.)</p>

<p>When the pope heard of this answer he talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
angrily of “the old madman” who dared to sit in
judgment on him, and blustered about the king of
England being his vassal. The cardinals, however,
said frankly that Grosseteste had spoken the truth,
and that he was far too good a man to be condemned.
“He is Catholic,” they declared, “and of
deepest holiness. More religious, and more saintly
than we are, and of better life. They say that
among all the bishops there is no one his equal, still
less his superior. All the clergy of France and
England know this. Besides, he is considered a
great philosopher, thoroughly learned in Latin and
Greek; and he is zealous for justice, and a man who
deals in theology, a preacher to the people, a lover
of chastity, and a persecutor of those who practise
simony.” So they extolled him. And it is to the
everlasting credit of the cardinals of the Roman See
in that year 1253 that they could discern the sincerity
and the great qualities of the brave old bishop who
defied the pope’s unrighteous commands. There
was no question at Rome of any disloyalty on
Grosseteste’s part to the Holy See, no suggestion
of any failing as a good Catholic.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> And Pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Innocent IV. wisely let the matter drop, when the
cardinals assured him it would never do to interfere
with Grosseteste.</p>

<p>Before he died Grosseteste made a last appeal “to
the nobles of England, the citizens of London and
the community of the whole realm” on behalf of
the Rights of the English Church, making a careful
list of the ills to be redressed. He also solemnly
charged his friend Simon of Montfort, never, as he
valued his immortal soul, to forsake the cause of the
English people, but to stand up even to the death,
if needs be, for a true and just government, and
with prophetic foresight spoke of the heavier troubles
coming on the land.</p>

<p>On October 9th, 1253, the long life and the magnificent
battling with odds were over, and the great
bishop passed away. He was buried in Lincoln
Cathedral, and in 1307, King Edward I. and the
dean and chapter of St. Paul’s made application for
his canonization, but without success. Fifty years
later and Edward III.’s Statutes of Provisors, 1351,
and Praemunire, 1353, by their prohibition of papal
bulls and of the appointment of papal nominees to
English benefices, may be accepted as the real
acknowledgment of Grosseteste’s political work.</p>

<p>“I confidently assert (wrote Matthew Paris) that
his virtues pleased God more than his failings displeased
Him.”</p>

<h3 class="left">SIMON OF MONTFORT AND<br />
THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
<span class="subhead">1258–1265</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">“In</span> the year of our Lord 1238, which was the
twenty-second of his reign, King Henry
held his court in London at Westminster,
and there on the day after Epiphany, which
was a Thursday, Simon de Montfort solemnly espoused
Eleanor, daughter of King John, sister of
Henry III., and widow of William Marshall, Earl of
Pembroke. The king himself gave away the bride
to the said Simon, Earl of Leicester, who received
her gratefully by reason of his disinterested love for
her, her own beauty, the rich honours that were
attached to her, and the distinguished and royal
descent of the lady, for she was the legitimate
daughter of a king and queen, and furthermore was
sister of a king, of an empress (the wife of Frederic
II.), and of a queen (Joan, wife of Alexander II. of
Scotland). Our lord the pope, too, gave him a dispensation
to marry this noble lady.”</p>

<p>Thus Matthew Paris, when Earl Simon, then a
man about thirty-seven, and “tall and handsome,”
enjoyed the royal favour and stood godfather to the
infant Prince Edward. Simon had only done homage
as Earl of Leicester in 1232; his boyhood was
passed in France, and his father was the great
soldier who led the French crusade against the
Albigenses. Earl Richard of Cornwall, Henry’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
brother—soon to become King of the Romans—objected
to the marriage, regarding it as one more
victory for the foreigners whom Henry nourished at
the expense of England. But Simon was no real
alien. His grandmother had been sister and heiress
of the Earl of Leicester, and Simon’s French training
no more made him a stranger in England than did
Stephen Langton’s years of study in Paris and
Rome unfit him for the primacy of the English
Church.</p>

<p>Henry’s favour was short-lived. Earl Simon
made friends with Earl Richard and left for the
crusades, disgusted with the king’s want of honesty.
So much wisdom did he show in Palestine, and so
great was his prowess, that Simon might have stayed
in the east as regent for the young King of Jerusalem.
But he had work to do in England, and
came home with Richard in 1242.</p>

<p>Here against all the disorder of misrule and the
royal and papal extortions Simon laboured with his
friend Bishop Grosseteste, and he is conspicuous at
the Parliament of Westminster in 1244, and in
drawing up the great protest to the pope a year later.</p>

<p>Then for five years (1248–53) Simon was in
Gascony contending with a body of nobles whom
neither Henry II. nor Richard I. had been able to
make good subjects, and whose only object in
making formal acknowledgment of Henry III. was to
escape the rule of Louis of France. Henry gave
Simon neither men nor money, and lent a willing
ear to all the complaints of Simon’s enemies in Gascony
and in England.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> At his own expense the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Earl of Leicester saved Gascony for the English
crown, and brought peace and law and trade to that
province. Henry’s return was to make Simon
answer trumped-up charges of robbery, cruelty and
treason brought by Gascons in 1252. The charges
were not proved, although Henry sent his own
commissioner to Gascony to make enquiry. Earl
Richard and other nobles who knew the country
were convinced of Simon’s justice, and Simon, who
was in England trying to raise supplies, turned
sharply on the king, reminding him of unfulfilled
promises. “Keep thy agreement with me,” he went
on, “or pay me the money I have spent in thy service;
for it is well known I have impoverished my
earldom beyond recovery for the honour of the
king.” “There is no shame in breaking my word to
a traitor,” the king answered angrily. At this Simon
in open wrath declared the king a liar, only saved
by the shelter of royalty from the penalty of his
speech. “Call thyself a Christian?” said the earl.
“Dost thou ever confess thy sins?” “Yes,” said the
king, “I do.” “Thy confession is useless without repentance
and atonement.” said the earl. The king,
more angry than ever, retorted, “I repent of one thing,
and that is that I made thee an earl in England, to
wax fat and kick against me. Get thee to Gascony,
thou who lovest strife, and take thy fill there and
meet thy father’s fate.” “I go willingly, my lord,”
came the answer. “And, ungrateful as thou art, I
will not return till I have made these rebels thy subjects
and thy enemies thy footstool.”</p>

<p>Simon returned to Gascony, and though Henry
again undermined his authority, he kept his word,
only giving up his command when the work was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>Adam of Marsh, a Franciscan friar, the friend
and correspondent of Grosseteste, often writes to
Simon in those days, encouraging and advising him.
“Better is patience in a man than force,” says Adam,
“and better he who rules his own passions than he
who storms a city.” He prays this strong upright
soldier-statesman to find comfort in the frequent
reading of the Holy Scriptures, “breaking through
as far as you can the cares and distractions of storm
and trouble,” and recommends the 29th, 30th and
31st chapters of the book of Job, “together with the
delightful commentaries of St. Gregory.”</p>

<p>Once more back in England, the time soon came
when Simon was the recognised leader of the barons
in their struggle with the king. And this leadership
gave England its first representative parliament.</p>

<p>Henry was in greater financial difficulties than
ever in 1257. The mad scheme of accepting the
crown of Sicily for his second son Edmund from the
pope, on condition that the cost of driving out Manfred,
the Emperor Frederick’s son, undertaken by
the pope, was to be paid for by England, had been
adopted by Henry in spite of the opposition of
bishops and nobles. Henry pledged his kingdom
with the pope as security for the expenditure in
Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and at last in the parliament of 1257 had to
confess his indebtedness. Fourteen thousand marks
were owing to Pope Alexander, and this wretched
debt, in addition to the general contempt for law and
justice by the king’s judges, sheriffs and foreign
favourites, drove matters to a climax. The wet
summer of 1257, followed by a failure at harvest,
brought famine in the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>The barons insisted that the time had come for
constitutional amendment. “The king’s mistakes
call for special treatment,” said Richard, Earl of
Gloucester, at a parliament early in 1258, and Simon,
closely related to the royal house as he was, agreed.
The swarm of royal parasites from Poitou raised
objections to any interference with Henry’s prerogative,
but were swept aside. “If the king can’t do
without us in war he must listen to us in peace.
And what sort of peace is this when the king is led
astray by bad counsellors and the land is filled with
foreign tyrants who grind down native-born Englishmen?”
So the barons argued.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>To Henry’s threat, “I will send reapers and reap
your fields for you,” Hugh Bigod of Norfolk had
retorted briskly, “And I will send you back the
heads of your reapers.”</p>

<p>Parliament met again in June that year at Oxford—the
“Mad Parliament” it was called—and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
barons came fully armed, for civil war seemed imminent.
But the barons led by Richard of Gloucester
and Earl Simon carried all before them and the war
was postponed for five years.</p>

<p>The work of this parliament, well known as the
Provisions of Oxford, was one more attempt to get
the Great Charter honestly observed. Under this
<span class="locked">constitution:—</span></p>

<p>The king was to have a standing council of fifteen,
by whose advice he was to act, and to whom the
justiciar, chancellor and treasurer were to be accountable.</p>

<p>Parliament was to meet three times a year—February,
June and October. Four knights were
to be chosen by the king’s lesser freehold tenant-knights
in each county.</p>

<p>To save expense twelve commissioners were to be
chosen to represent the baronage—“and the commonalty
shall hold as established that which these
twelve shall do.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The fifteen counsellors consisted
of six of the king’s party, and nine of the barons’—the
most conspicuous of the latter were Simon of
Montfort, Richard of Gloucester, and Bishop Cantilupe,
of Worcester.</p>

<p>Then the oath was taken, “that neither for life
nor death, for hatred or love, or for any cause whatever,
would they be bent or weakened in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
purpose to regain praiseworthy laws, and to cleanse
the kingdom from foreigners.”</p>

<p>Henry and Prince Edward, his eldest son, took the
oath willingly enough—though the latter soon began
“to draw back from it so far as he could.” The
king’s half-brothers and the rest of the aliens not only
refused the oath, but swore that as long as they had
breath they would never surrender their castles,
revenues, or wardships.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Simon, who on the
ground of his foreign birth had at once yielded his
castles of Kenilworth and Odiham, without recompense,
turned to William de Valence—who was
blustering more than the rest—and said sharply,
“To a certainty you shall either surrender your
castles or lose your head.” The barons made it
plain that they were in agreement with this, and
then were the Poitevins afraid, not knowing what to
do; “for if they hid themselves in their castles they
would be starved out; for all the people would
besiege them and utterly destroy their castles.” The
aliens fled to the continent, and the new constitution
was proclaimed in every county—in Latin, French,
and English.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Twenty years had passed since Henry had blessed
Simon’s marriage with his sister Eleanor, and Simon
had stood godfather to Prince Edward, and now
after the Parliament at Oxford, meeting the Earl of
Leicester in the Bishop of Durham’s palace on the
Thames bank, the king cannot conceal his fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the one man who held up the good cause—“like a
pillar that cannot be moved.” The king had taken
refuge from a thunderstorm, and to Simon’s assurance
that the storm was passing, and was no longer to be
feared, answered grimly, “I fear thunder and
lightning a good deal, Lord Simon, but by the
Head of God, I fear you more than all the thunder
and lightning in the world.”</p>

<p>“Everyone suspected that these astounding words
broke from the king because the Earl of Leicester
manfully and boldly persevered in carrying out the
provisions, compelling the king and all the enemies
of these provisions to assent to them, and utterly
banishing his brothers, who were corrupting the
whole kingdom.” (Matthew Paris.)</p>

<p>Manfully as the great earl might strive, he could
not accomplish the carrying out of the Provisions of
Oxford. Henry was quickly at his old work,
obtaining from Rome a dispensation from his old
promises on the ground they had been obtained by
compulsion, and bringing back his foreign supporters.
The barons neither held together nor made any
serious effort to promote good government.</p>

<p>Richard of Gloucester, jealous of Simon, fell away
from the national cause before his death in 1262.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>Prince Edward stood by his oath, but did nothing
to prevent the break-up of the provisional government,
and soon openly supported his father.</p>

<p>In spite of all this the Provisions, modified at
Westminster in 1259, endured for five years, and
then it seemed as if nothing could save the country
from civil war. As a last resource appeal was made
by both sides to King Louis of France to arbitrate
concerning the fulfilment of the Provisions, and at
Amiens, in January, 1264, the award was given.
Louis solemnly gave sentence for the king against
the barons, entirely annulling the Statutes and Provisions
of Oxford, and in particular declaring the
king free to appoint his own ministers, councils, and
sheriffs, and to employ aliens. But by the award—the
mise—of Amiens the earlier charters given by
the crown were to remain, and all disputes arising
out of the Parliament of Oxford were to be suppressed.
Louis gave as a reason for annulling the provisions
that the pope had already annulled them.</p>

<p>The appellants had turned to Louis hoping for
peace. The award was the signal for war. Many
of the bishops and barons at once withdrew from
Simon, who answered the deserters by declaring,
“Though all should forsake us, I and my four sons
will fight to the death in the righteous cause I have
sworn to uphold, to the honour of the Church and
the good of the realm. Many lands have I travelled,
heathen and Christian, but nowhere have I seen
such bad faith and falsehood as in England.”</p>

<p>London was enthusiastic in its support of the
barons, and the Cinque Ports, the scholars of
Oxford, and the Dominican and Franciscan friars
were all on the side of reform. Chief among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Simon’s supporters were Bishop Cantilupe, of Worcester,
Gilbert, the young Earl of Gloucester, Hugh
le Despenser, the justiciar, and Roger Bigod.</p>

<p>War began in March, when Prince Edward
captured Gloucester, joined Henry at Oxford, and
then seized Nottingham and Northampton, while
Simon and the citizens of London attacked
Rochester. Henry turned south, and encamped in
full force near Lewes.</p>

<p>Again Simon laboured for peace, and in his own
name and the name of Gilbert of Gloucester, the
Bishops of Worcester and London went as ambassadors
to Henry. Simon offered £30,000 to the
king if he would make peace and keep to the Provisions
of Oxford, and assured him that he had
taken up arms not against Henry but against those
who were “not only our enemies, but yours, and
those of the whole kingdom.”</p>

<p>The king treated the proposal with scorn, and
Prince Edward added an additional message of
contempt.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May the battle of Lewes was
fought and won by Simon, “through a singular conjunction
of skill and craft on the one side, and rashness
and panic on the other.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>The Earl of Leicester went into the battle fighting
for his country and his oath, and with the exhortation
to his men “to pray God, if this our undertaking
be pleasing in His sight, to give us might to fulfil
the same, serving Him as good knights.”</p>

<p>The stout old Bishop of Worcester blessed the
troops, “who had among them all but one faith, one
will in all things, one love towards God and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
neighbour, so that they feared neither to offend the
king nor even to die for the sake of justice, rather
than violate their oaths.” (Matthew of Westminster.)</p>

<p>At the end of the day the defeat of the royalists
was complete, and the king, Prince Edward and his
kinsmen were prisoners.</p>

<p>Then peace was made, Henry once more swearing
to keep the charters and articles of Oxford, to employ
no aliens, to submit the Provisions to arbitration
again, to live thriftily till his debts were paid,
and to give his son Edward and his nephew Henry
as hostages for good behaviour till a permanent
reform in the constitution was made. Early in June
these terms of peace were proclaimed in London, to
the general satisfaction, and on all sides the people
shouted their thankfulness to Simon.</p>

</div>

<p>And now in the summer of 1264 Earl Simon was
to show what he could do for England, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
victory of Lewes had placed power in his hands, and
he stood indisputably the foremost man in the realm.
For one short year his counsel was to guide the
destinies of England and to make that year memorable
for all time by the creation of the first representative
Parliament.</p>

<p>A new scheme of government was at once drawn
up. Three electors chosen by the barons were to
appoint a council of nine for the guidance of the
king, and Simon of Montfort, Gilbert of Gloucester,
and Stephen Berksted, Bishop of Chichester, were
speedily chosen as the three electors. Hugh le
Despenser remained justiciar, and Thomas Cantilupe,
the bishop’s nephew, became chancellor. (This
Thomas subsequently became Bishop of Hereford,
died in Italy, and was canonized.)</p>

<p>Then in December came the issue of writs for
Simon of Montfort’s famous Full Parliament of 1265.
Two knights are to be returned from each shire, and
for the first time from each city and borough the
burgesses are to send two representatives. Hitherto
Parliament had consisted of barons and clergy, and
knights sent by the king’s tenants, and the representation
of the townspeople was unknown. Simon’s
earlier policy at Oxford had done nothing to extend
the basis of government or create a national responsibility
for the laws. “The provisions of 1258
restricted, the constitutions of 1264 extended the
limits of parliament.... Either Simon’s views of a
constitution had rapidly developed, or the influence
which had checked them in 1258 were removed.
Anyhow, he had had genius to interpret the mind of
the nation and to anticipate the line which was taken
by later progress.” (Stubbs.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>This development of Simon’s views may fairly be
traced to his close and intimate connection with the
Dominican friars.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Simon’s father, the warrior of
the Albigensian wars, had been the warm friend of
St. Dominic. Simon himself was equally the friend
of Bishop Grosseteste, the champion of the friars.
As far back as 1245 Simon had founded a Dominican
priory at Leicester. In 1263 he had been present at
a General Chapter of the Dominican Order in Holborn,
London, and the Parliament of Oxford had
met in a Dominican priory in that city. All along
the friars had supported the popular movement.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Now the peculiarity of the Dominican Order of
Friars is its representative form of government.
Each priory sends two representatives to its provincial
chapter, and each province sends two representatives
to the general chapter of the order.</p>

<p>Simon of Montfort, when the opportunity came to
him for striking out a reform in the English Parliament,
adopted the plan which he had studied and
seen at work amongst the Preaching Friars. “The
idea of representative government had ripened in his
hand,” and his genius interpreted the mind of the
nation. In spite of all the scorn that has been
poured on popular elections and the Houses of
Parliament, in spite of all the imperfections that
necessarily are attached to any constitutional system
devised by the wit of man, the idea of representative
government has become the inspiration of the
nations of the world. The failings of democracy are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
obvious, the weak spots in popular electoral systems
glaring; but mankind, once grasping the idea of
freedom in politics, clamours eagerly for responsibility
in law-making and the administration of justice,
and refuses to rest satisfied under any despotism or
bureaucracy, benevolent or malevolent. Suppressed
by dictators, perverted by demagogues, abused by
the unscrupulous in power, there still seems nothing
better in politics for mankind than self-government.
“Better is he who rules his own temper than he who
storms a city,” wrote Friar Adam of Marsh to Simon
of Montfort. “Better self-government for a people
than world-wide conquest,” the average man declares,
and the opinion slowly moulds the destinies of
nations, till “patriotism” becomes the word for good
service in politics.</p>

<p>The verse of the thirteenth century <span class="locked">chronicler:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The king that tries without advice to seek his people’s will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must often fail, he cannot know the woes and wants they feel,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">gets re-expression in the nineteenth century in Abraham
Lincoln’s: “Government of the people, by the
people, for the people.” Always threatened by the
personal ambition of man, often overthrown when
ambition held the sword of power, contemptible
to the wise and prudent because of the simplicity and
innocence of “the people,” denounced as dangerous
by the professional expert in bureaucracy because of
the ignorance of “the people,” its inadequacy the
common theme of the disappointed—representative
government survives its enemies, defies its critics, and
with its blemishes unconcealed, finds the company of
its lovers ever increasing and recruiting in its behalf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
For since that first Full Parliament of Earl Simon’s
in 1265 it has never been possible to get rid of the
notion that representative government was a key to
the portals of freedom; and though the wider the
freedom the greater the responsibility, to the credit
of the race at all times men and women have pressed
forward, not rejecting responsibility.</p>

<p>Simon’s parliament sat from January to March.
Its chief business was the confirmation of the treaty
of peace at Lewes, and Henry swore as usual to
maintain the new constitution, the charters and provisions.
The government was short-lived. Danger
from France, where the queen and Archbishop Boniface
of Canterbury and all Henry’s alien courtiers
planned invasion with an army collected in Holland,
had passed away at the close of the previous summer.
There had been a great muster of troops for national
defence near Dover, bad weather had incapacitated
the queen’s fleet, and Louis of France agreed to
negotiations in place of war. The Cinque Ports
mariners refused a landing to the pope’s legate, who
was ready to excommunicate the new government,
and flung his papal bull in the sea.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Not from abroad but from within came the foes
who overthrew Simon’s government and murdered
the great statesman. Earl Gilbert, of Gloucester,
like his father, grew jealous of Simon’s leadership,
and disputed his authority as to the ransom of some
of the prisoners of Lewes, and Simon’s sons added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
fuel to the flame by their pride and overbearing
insolence. Roger Mortimer and some of the nobles
of the Welsh marches rose for King Henry in the
spring of 1265, and Gilbert deserted the barons for
the king.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> William of Valence landed in South
Wales with a body of crossbowmen in May, and
when Simon reached Hereford to put down the
rebellion, Prince Edward, who, with the king, had
been in Simon’s custody, made his escape to Mortimer
and the marches.</p>

<p>Edward quickly raised troops, and joined Gilbert
at Ludlow, where he took an oath to obey the laws
and charters of the realm. Simon, in some danger
of being cut off by this movement on his rear, sent
word to his second son—Simon—to go to Kenilworth
and join him at Evesham, and then turned
back from Wales.</p>

<p>The younger Simon was surprised at Kenilworth
by a sudden raid by Edward. His camp was broken
up, his banners taken, and he was driven back into
the castle. Edward, fully aware that Earl Simon
had only a small force with him, hurried off to
Evesham to attack him, before young Simon could
rally his scattered troops and come to his father’s
help.</p>

<p>On the morning of August 4th Earl Simon halted
at Evesham, and at the king’s request, for Henry
was still his captive, heard mass and dined. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
son’s army, now on its way, halted for the same
purpose at Alcester. “He was now only ten miles
distant and the junction of father and son seemed
secure.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> But Prince Edward was already between
them. “As the morning broke his army lay across
the road that led northward from Evesham to
Alcester. Ere three hours had passed the corpse of
the great earl lay mangled amid a ring of faithful
knights, and the ‘murder of Evesham, for battle
none it was,’ was over.”</p>

<p>At first Simon thought the advancing army was
his son’s, for Edward displayed the captured banners
of Kenilworth, but when he saw the standards of the
prince and of Gloucester, and the well-known banner
of Mortimer, the truth was clear.</p>

<p>“By the arm of St. James,” cried the earl, “they
come on skilfully, for they have turned my lessons
against me. God have mercy on our souls, for our
bodies are theirs! Though if Simon were to come
up we might hope yet.” He turned to his eldest
son, and pointing to the banner of Gloucester said,
“See, Henry, what your pride has done.”</p>

<p>In vain Henry urged his father to fly while escape
was possible. “I had as lief die here in a good
cause as in the Holy Land,” said the earl, and the
barons and knights standing round were equally
resolute to fight to the end—though they had but
two men to every seven of the enemy. The good
Bishop of Worcester blessed the little army as he
had done at Lewes, and then the battle began. The
Welsh footsoldiers quickly lost heart and fled from
Simon and the field, and the barons were soon
hemmed in. One by one they fell—Henry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Montfort, Hugh le Despenser, the wise and upright
justiciar, and Simon himself, wounded and unhorsed,
“fought on to the last like a giant for the
liberties of England.” A soldier stabbed him in the
back under the mail he wore, and then he was borne
down and slain, overwhelmed by numbers rather
than conquered. “So a death full of honour ended
the chivalry and prowess, ennobled by so many
deeds in so many lands.” “Thus lamentably fell
the flower of knighthood, leaving to others an
example of steadfast courage. Who can prevent
the treachery of friends? Those who had eaten his
bread had raised their heels against him. Those
who had spoken words of love to him with their lips
lied in their throats, for their hearts were not right
with him, and they betrayed him in his hour of
need.” (W. Rishanger.)</p>

<p>For nearly three hours the unequal battle was
fought, in the midst of storm and darkness. So
dark was it that King Henry, who had been forced
to remain with Simon’s knights, had difficulty in
saving his life, and was actually wounded by a javelin
before he was recognized by Edward’s soldiers.</p>

<p>The monks of Evesham carried the bodies of
some of the barons into the abbey for burial, and
after horrible mutilations by the victors the remains
of the great earl were reverently interred by the
side of Hugh le Despenser, before the high altar.</p>

<p>“Those who knew Simon praise his piety, admire
his learning, and extol his prowess as a knight and
skill as a general. They tell of his simple fare and
plain russet dress, bearing witness to his kindly
speech and firm friendship to all good men, describe
his angry scorn for liars and unjust men, and marvel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
at his zeal for truth and right, which was such that
neither pleasure nor threats nor promises could turn
him aside from keeping the oath he swore at Oxford;
for he held up the good cause ‘like a pillar that
cannot be moved, and like a second Josiah esteemed
righteousness the very healing of his soul.’ As a
statesman he wished to bind the king to rule according
to law, and to make the king’s ministers responsible
to a full Parliament; and though he did not
live to see the success of his policy, he had
pointed out the way by which future statesmen
might bring it about.” (F. York Powell.)</p>

<p>The news of Simon’s death was received with
general mourning as it spread over the land. He
was acclaimed by the people as a saint and martyr,
and miracles were said to be worked by his relics.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
The Franciscan friars drew up a service in his
honour—“consisting of lessons, responses, verses,
hymns, and other matter appertaining to the honour
and respect due to a martyr.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> But the pope who
had excommunicated Simon was not likely to hear of
canonization, and “as long as Edward lives the service
compiled in Simon’s honour cannot gain acceptance
to be chanted within the church of God, which
was hoped for.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The “Lament of Earl Simon,”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> compared the
mighty statesman with Thomas of Canterbury:</p>

<p>The good cause for which Simon had fought
might well have seemed lost, when Edward’s
knights were hacking the dead body of the great
earl to pieces at Evesham. But it was not exactly
a “Royalist victory,” for the very men who stood
victors over the mangled corpse of Earl Simon were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
men as resolute as he was to enforce the Great
Charter and its results against the king.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>In the hour of triumph Henry struck hard, and a
mad reaction of terror ensued. But the movement
Simon had led could not be turned back, and the
very savage extravagance of the royalist party
defeated its own ends. A general sentence of
disinheritance against all who had fought with
Simon drove the disinherited barons to keep up
the fight. The siege of Kenilworth, where Sir
Henry of Hastings defied the whole royal army,
lasted from June to December, 1266, and was only
ended by Parliament insisting on the king appointing
a board of twelve, who made a just award
concerning the disinherited. By this award, called
the Ban of <span class="locked">Kenilworth:—</span></p>

<p>The royal obligation to keep the charters was
required.</p>

<p>The acts of Simon were annulled, and the full
prerogatives of the crown declared.</p>

<p>The freedom of the Church was demanded.</p>

<p>Justice was to be done according to the laws and
customs of the realm.</p>

<p>The adherents of Simon were to be punished by
fine and not by disinheritance, so that the king
could repay those who had served him faithfully
without giving occasion for fresh war.</p>

<p>Simon was not to be proclaimed a saint (seeing
he died under the excommunication of the Church),
and those who spread idle tales of miracles done at
his tomb were to be punished.</p>

<p>A complete indemnity was promised to all who
accepted the ban within forty days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>For a time the ban was rejected, and it was not till
the summer of 1267 that the struggle was finally over.
Peace was assured by the Parliament of Marlborough
in November, 1267, which re-enacted the Provisions
of Westminster (1259) as a statute.</p>

<p>The lasting value of Simon’s work was seen in
1295, when Edward I. summoned his great representative
parliament on the professed principle that
“that which touches all shall be approved by all.”
This assembly, by that very principle, served as “a
pattern for all future assemblies of the nation.”
(Stubbs.)</p>

<p>Had Simon of Montfort received canonization by
the Church he would surely have been the patron
saint of all workers in the world of politics, and of all
who honestly and courageously engage in public
work.</p>

<h3 class="left">WAT TYLER AND THE<br />
PEASANT REVOLT

<span class="subhead">1381</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> Peasant Revolt of 1381, led by Wat
Tyler, was not only the first great national
movement towards democracy, it was the
first uprising of the English people in
opposition to all their hitherto recognised rulers in
Church and State, and it was the first outburst in
this land against social injustice.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>The Black Death in 1349 and the pestilence that
ravaged the country in 1361 and 1369 upset the old
feudal order. The land was in many places utterly
bereft of labour, and neither king nor parliament
could restore the former state of things. Landowners,
driven by the scarcity of labour, went in for
sheep farming in place of agriculture, and were compelled
to offer an increase of wages in spite of the
Statutes of Labourers (1351–1353) which expressly
forbade the <span class="locked">same:—</span></p>

<p>“Every man or woman of whatsoever condition,
free or bond, able in body, and within the age of
three-score years, and not having of his own whereof
he may live, nor land of his own about the tillage of
which he may occupy himself, and not serving any
other, shall be bound to serve the employer who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
shall require him to do so, and take only the wages
which were accustomed to be taken in the neighbourhood
two years before the pestilence.”</p>

<p>This act remained the law until the fifth year of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Free” labourers, landless men but not serfs,
wandered away to the towns or turned outlaws in
the forests. Serfs—only a small number of the
population, for the Church had always recommended
their liberation, even while abbots and priors retained
them on Church estates, and Edward III. had encouraged
granting freedom in return for payment in
money—escaped to those incorporated towns that
promised freedom after eighteen months’ residence.
Villeins and lesser tenants commuted the service due
from them to their landlords by money payments,
and so began the leasehold system of land tenure.</p>

<p>For thirty years preceding the Peasant Revolt
the social changes had bred discontent, and discontent
rather than misery is always the parent of
revolt.</p>

<p>An early statute of Richard II., framed for the
perpetual bondage of the serfs, heightened the discontent.</p>

<p>“No bondman or bondwoman shall place their
children at school, as has been done, so as to advance
their children in the world by their going into the
Church.”</p>

<p>This same act made equal prohibition against
apprenticeship in the town.</p>

<p>The free labourer had his grievance against the
Statute of Labourers. Villeins and cottar tenants
had no sure protection against being compelled to
give labour service to their lords; and they, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
the freehold yeomen and the town workmen and
shopkeepers, hated the heavy taxation, the oppressive
market tolls and the general misgovernment.</p>

<p>To unite all these forces of social discontent into
one great army, which should destroy the oppression
and establish freedom and brotherhood, was the work
John Ball—an itinerant priest who came at first
from St. Mary’s at York, and then made Colchester
the centre of his journeyings—devoted himself to for
twenty years.</p>

<p>Ball preached a social revolution, and his gospel
was that all men were brothers, and that serfdom and
lordship were incompatible with brotherhood. In
our times such teaching is common enough, but in
the fourteenth century, with its sumptuary laws and
its feudal ranks, only in religion was this principle
accepted.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> John Ball became the moving spirit in
the agitation set on foot by his teaching. He had
his colleagues and lieutenants, John Wraw in Suffolk
and Jack Straw in Essex—both priests like himself—William
Grindcobbe in Hertford and Geoffrey
Litster in Norfolk. The peasants were organised
into clubs, and letters were sent by Ball far and wide
to stir up revolt. In Kent and the eastern counties
lay the main strength of the revolutionaries—it was
in Kent that Ball was particularly active just before
the rising—but Sussex, Hampshire, Lincolnshire,
Warwickshire, Yorkshire and Somerset were all
affected, so grave and so general was the dissatisfaction,
and so hopeful to the labouring people was the
message delivered by John Ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>Of course Ball did not escape censure and the
penalty of law during his missionary years. He
was excommunicated and cast into prison by three
Archbishops of Canterbury, Islip, Simon Langham,
and Simon Sudbury, for teaching “errors, schisms,
and scandals against the popes, archbishops, bishops,
and clergy,” and he was only released from prison,
from Archbishop Sudbury’s gaol at Maidstone, by
the rough hands of the men of Kent when the rising
had begun. The “errors” of John Ball were civil and
social rather than theological. The notion that Ball
and his fellow socialists of the fourteenth century were
mixed up with Wycliff and the Lollards has really no
foundation in fact.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> Wycliff’s unorthodox views on
the sacraments and his attacks on the habits of the
clergy were of no interest to the social revolutionists,
and John of Gaunt, the steady friend of Wycliff,
was hated above all other men in the realm by the
leaders of the revolt. Wycliff expressed as little
sympathy with the Peasant Revolt of his day as
Luther later in Germany did with the Peasant War,
or Cranmer with the Norfolk rising under Ket in
1549.</p>

<p>John Ball’s sermons were all on one text—“In
the beginning of the world there were no bondmen,
all men were created equal. Servitude of man to
man is contrary to God’s will.” He declared that
“things will never go well in England so long as
goods are not kept in common, and so long as there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
are villeins and gentlefolks.” He harped on the
social inequalities of his age, quoting freely from
Langland’s <cite>Piers the Plowman</cite>, and enlarging on
the famous couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When Adam delved and Eve span,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who was then the gentleman?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As years went by and the time grew ripe for
revolt, there is a definite call to rise in Ball’s letters and
speeches. “Let us go to the king, and remonstrate
with him,” he declares, “telling him we must have it
otherwise, or we ourselves shall find the remedy.”</p>

<p>Richard II. was but eleven when he came to the
throne in 1377. “He is young. If we wait on him
in a body, all those who come under the name of
serf or are held in bondage will follow us, in the
hope of being free. When the king shall see us we
shall obtain a favourable answer, or we must then
ourselves seek to amend our condition.”</p>

<p>Some of the rhymed letters Ball sent out, bidding
his hearers “stand together manfully in the truth,”
urge preparation for the coming conflict:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In other letters he greets John Nameless, John
the Miller, and John Carter, and bids them stand
together in God’s name; and bids Piers Plowman “go
to his work and chastise well Hob the Robber (Sir
Robert Hales, the king’s treasurer); and take with
you John Trueman and all his fellows, and look that
you choose one head and no more.”</p>

<p>These letters and the preaching did their work;
the peasants were organised; men of marked courage
and ability were found in various counties; and
“the one head and no more” was ready in Kent to
lead the army of revolt to the king when the signal
should be given. Litster, Grindcobbe, and Wraw
were at their posts. In every county from Somerset
to York the peasants flocked together, “some armed
with clubs, rusty swords, axes, with old bows
reddened by the smoke of the chimney corner, and
odd arrows with only one feather.”</p>

<p>John Ball had rung his bell, and at Whitsuntide,
at the end of May, 1381, came the great uprising,
the “Hurling-Time of the Peasants.” The fire was
all ready to be kindled, and a poll-tax, badly ordered,
set the country ablaze.</p>

<p>The poll-tax was first levied, in 1377, on all over
fourteen years of age. Two years later it was
graduated, from 4d. on every man and woman of the
working class to £6 13s. 4d. on a duke or
archbishop. Even this with a further tax on wool
was found insufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>So early in 1381 John of Gaunt called the parliament
together at Northampton, and declared that
£160,000 must be raised. Parliament refused to
find more than £100,000, and the clergy, owning at
that time one-third of the land, promised £60,000.
Again a poll-tax was demanded. This time everybody
over fifteen was required to pay 1s., but in districts
where wealthy folks lived it was held sufficient that
the amount collected in every parish averaged 1s.
per head; only the rich were not to pay less than
£1 per household, nor the poor less than 8d. In
parishes where all were needy the full shilling was
demanded without exception. It soon appeared
that the money was not to be raised. In many
parts the returns as to the population liable to the
tax were not even filled in with any attempt at
accuracy, and numbers avoided liability by leaving
their homes—to escape a tribute, which to the
struggling peasant meant ruin. Of the £100,000
required only £22,000 was forthcoming.</p>

<p>Then one John Legge undertook to supply the
deficit, if he had the authority of the crown to act
as special commissioner to collect the tax. The
appointment was made, with the result that the
methods of the tax-collectors provoked revolt, and
Legge lost his life over the business.</p>

<p>The rising began in Essex, when the villagers of
Fobbing, Corringham, and Stanford-le-Hope were
summoned to meet the tax-commissioner at Brentwood.
Unable to pay, they fell upon the collectors
and killed them. The government met this assault
by sending down Chief Justice Belknap to punish
the offenders. But as the judge merely had for
escort a certain number of legal functionaries, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the blood of the people was up, Belknap was received
with open contempt, and, forced to swear on the
Bible that he would hold no other session in the
place, was glad to escape from the town without
injury. And with this defiance and overpowering of
the king’s officers the signal was given, the beacon of
revolt well lighted.</p>

<p>It was June 2nd, Whit Sunday, when the Chief
Justice was driven out of Brentwood; two days
later Kent had risen at Gravesend and Dartford.</p>

<p>At Gravesend Sir Simon Burley, the friend of
Richard II., seized a workman in the town, claiming
him as a bondsman of his estate, and clapped him in
Rochester Castle, refusing to hear of release unless
£300 was paid.</p>

<p>At the same time word went about that the tax-collector
at Dartford was insulting the women, and
that, in especial, the wife and daughter of one John
Tyler had been abused with gross indecency.</p>

<p>Whereupon this John Tyler, “being at work in
the same town tyling of an house, when he heard
thereof, caught his lathing staff in his hand, and ran
reaking home; where, reasoning with the collector, who
made him so bold, the collector answered with stout
words, and strake at the tyler; whereupon the tyler,
avoiding the blow, smote the collector with his lathing
staff, so that the brains flew out of his head.
Wherethrough great noise arose in the streets, and
the poor people being glad, everyone prepared to
support the said John Tyler.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Robert Cave, a master baker of Dartford, led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
people straight off to Rochester; and the castle
having been stormed, and all its prisoners released,
Sir John Newton, the governor of the castle, was
retained in safe custody.</p>

<p>And now the time had come for good generalship
and discipline in the ranks, if the fire of revolt was
to burn aright. Accordingly at Maidstone, on
June 7th, Wat Tyler is chosen captain of the host;
and proof is quickly given that the rising is not for
mob rule or general anarchy, but to redress positive
and intolerable wrongs. (Five Tylers are mentioned
in the records of the Peasant Revolt: Wat Tyler, of
Maidstone; John Tyler, of Dartford, who slays the
tax-collector, and is not heard of again; Walter Tyler,
of Essex; and two Tylers of the City of London—William,
of Stone Street, and Simon, of Cripplegate.)</p>

<p>In every respect was this Wat Tyler a man of
remarkable gifts. Chosen as leader by the voice
of his neighbours in Kent, his authority is at once
obeyed without dispute, and his influence is seen to
extend beyond the borders of his own county.
Jack Straw acts as his lieutenant; John Wraw, of
Suffolk, and William Grindcobbe, of St. Albans,
come to him for advice; and it is not till Tyler
moves on London with his army that the rising
becomes national. He is plainly marked out as a
great leader of masses of men. Skilful, courageous,
humane, Wat Tyler is proved to be; firm, clear-headed,
downright in manner, and yet large-hearted,
jovial and brotherly—equally at home with king or
beggar. There is nothing of the fanatical doctrinaire
about this first great leader of the English people.
He could order the execution of “traitors,” but
he is not the man for bloodshed in England if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
revolution he and John Ball aimed at can be accomplished
by peaceful means. After more than 500
years the reputation of Wat Tyler stands out untarnished
and unshaken.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Yet for eight days—and eight days only—does
history allow us to follow the career of this remarkable
man. On June 7th Wat Tyler was chosen by
the men of Kent to lead the revolt; on June 15th
he was dead. Of his antecedents we know nothing.
Parentage, birth-place, age, height, and personal
appearance, are all unrecorded. His trade alone we
can infer, and we know that his contemporaries
trusted him to the full: for no suggestion has been
made of any kind of rivalry or jealousy amongst the
leaders, or of criticism or grumbling amongst the
rank and file.</p>

<p>Wat Tyler emerges from the obscurity of history
to become a strong democratic leader. For eight
days he commands a vast army of men; he confronts
the king as an equal; orders the execution of the
chief ministers of the crown; and wrests from the
king promises of fundamental social importance.
Then, in the very hour of victory, an unexpected
blow from an enemy strikes him down, and death
follows. Surely to few men is it awarded to achieve
an immortal reputation in so brief a public life.</p>

<p>No sooner is Tyler acclaimed as leader at
Maidstone than the commons of Kent are flocking
to the standard of revolt. The cry is for “King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Richard and the Commons,” and it goes hard with
any who refuse to take the oath. John of Gaunt is
the enemy. John of Gaunt is held to be responsible
for all the mischief wrought on the coast towns of
Kent by the privateer fleets of the Scots and the
French, for the raiding of Rye and Winchelsea.
(Only in the previous year these fleets had invaded
the Thames as far as Gravesend.) John of Gaunt
is the head and front of the misrule that bled the
land with poll-taxes. John of Gaunt is the incarnation
of the landlord rule that would keep the
labourer in bondage for ever. So bitter is the
feeling against John of Gaunt, and so acute the fear
that he is aiming at the crown, that a vow is taken
by the men of Kent that no man named “John”
shall be King of England.</p>

<p>John of Gaunt was the common enemy. But
John of Gaunt was far away on the Scottish border,
and there were enemies near at hand to be dealt
with. The manor-houses of Kent were attacked;
in a few cases, where their owners were notoriously
bad landlords, were burnt. The main thing, however,
was to obtain the rent-rolls, the lists of tenants and
serfs, and all the documents of the lawyers. These
papers were seized and destroyed by the peasants,
for no assurance of freedom was possible while such
evidence of service could be produced. These
documents were the legal instruments of landlord
rule; and as the people had risen to end this rule,
a beginning had to be made by destroying the
machinery. There was no general reign of terror
in the country; there was nothing of the ferocity of
the Jacquerie in France; no slaughter of landlords;
and no common destruction of property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>The nobility seemed to expect judgment at the
hands of the people, and those who were at Plymouth
making preparation for their invasion of
France put to sea as quickly as possible when news
came of the rising.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> But the people had risen not
for blind vengeance or for civil war, and the class
who suffered badly at the rising were the lawyers
rather than the landlords. It was the lawyer’s hand
that the peasants saw and felt, and not the mailed
fist, for the lawyer was not only the land agent of the
lord of the manor, he was also the judge in matters
of dispute between landlord and tenant, and it was
he who kept the lists of villeins and serfs, and in the
service of his lord did not scruple to manipulate
those lists.</p>

<p>In those first days of the rising, when yeomen and
more than one landholder joined the army of revolt,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
and all who were willing to cry “King Richard and
the Commons” were counted as supporters, the
worst that the landlord suffered (except in extreme
cases) was the loss of his papers, but the lawyer
who clung to his office was often hanged without
mercy, as a scourge to the commonwealth.</p>

<p>Tyler was at Canterbury on Monday, June 10th,
and here Archbishop Sudbury’s palace was ransacked
for papers, and his tenant-rolls burnt. Beyond
this, and a rough exhortation to the monks to
prepare to elect a new archbishop, no injury was
done. The following day Tyler was back at Maidstone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
and his men burst open the archbishop’s
prison and released John Ball, with all others who
had incurred ecclesiastical displeasure. This accomplished,
with John Ball, the people’s poor priest, in
the midst of them, 30,000 men of Kent—yeomen,
craftsmen, villeins and peasants—set out for London
under Wat Tyler’s command.</p>

<p>Blackheath was reached at nightfall on Wednesday,
June 12th, and a camp fixed; but a few indefatigable
rebels hastened on to Southwark that same
night to burst open the Marshalsea and King’s
Bench prisons. John Wraw was at Blackheath, and
after a short conference with Wat Tyler, hastened
back to Suffolk to announce that the hour of rising
had struck.</p>

<p>Near Eltham Tyler had overtaken the young
king’s mother, the widow of the Black Prince, returning
from a pilgrimage, and had promised that no
harm should befall her or her women from his host.
Reassured, the princess and her company went on
their way in safety to the Tower of London, where
Richard and his council were assembled, and told
of the great uprising.</p>

<p>Judges had already been despatched into Kent at
the first news of the disorders, but had turned back
before reaching Canterbury, not liking the look of
things.</p>

<p>Early on Thursday morning, June 13th, the camp
at Blackheath was astir. It was Corpus Christi day
and a solemn festival. After mass had been said
before all the people, John Ball preached on his old
theme of equality and brotherhood. “For if God
had intended some to be serfs and others lords He
would have made a distinction between them at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
beginning.” He went on to speak of the work to be
taken in hand at once.</p>

<p>“Now is the opportunity given to Englishmen,
if they do but choose to take it, of casting off
the yoke they have borne so long, of winning the
freedom they have always desired. Wherefore let
us take good courage and behave like the wise husbandman
of scripture, who gathered the wheat into
his barn, but uprooted and burned the tares that had
half-choked the good grain. Now the tares of
England are her oppressive rulers, and the time of
harvest has come. Ours it is to pluck up these
tares and make away with them all—the evil lords,
the unjust judges, the lawyers, every man indeed
who is dangerous to the common good. Then
should we all have peace for the present and
security for the future. For when the great ones
have been rooted up and cast away, all will enjoy
equal freedom, all will have common nobility, rank
and power.”</p>

<p>The sermon was received with bursts of cheers,
and the people shouted that John Ball should be
archbishop, “for that the present archbishop and
chancellor, Simon Sudbury, was but a traitor.”</p>

<p>Later that morning Sir John Newton arrived at
the Tower with a message from Tyler, asking for an
audience with the king. All along it was the belief
of the commons that the king had but to hear the
tale of their wrongs and redress would be speedily
obtained.</p>

<p>“Hold no speech with the shoeless ruffians,” was
the advice of Sir Robert Hales, the treasurer. But
Richard agreed to an interview, and presently rowed
down the Thames in the royal barge as far as Rotherhithe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
with the Earl of Suffolk (President of the
Council), and the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick.</p>

<p>The river bank was crowded with the commons
of Kent, and Wat Tyler and John Ball urged the
king to land and listen to the message his subjects
brought. They were promptly rebuked by the Earl
of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> for their boldness:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you are not properly dressed, nor
are you in a fit condition for the king to talk to
you.”</p>

<p>Instead of landing, Richard listened to the counsels
of fear and pride, and the royal barge was
turned and rowed back swiftly to the Tower.</p>

<p>Wat Tyler and the men of Kent, with thousands
more from Surrey, at once marched on to London
Bridge, where they destroyed the houses of ill-fame
that clustered round the south side of the bridge.
The prisons had been pulled down the night before,
and now the brothels were burnt to the ground and
their inmates dismissed—that the new City of
God of John Ball’s vision might be cleansed of
its old foulness. These places of infamy, rented by
Flemish women, were the property of William
Walworth, the Mayor of London; and their destruction
filled him with rage against the invaders.</p>

<p>Walworth made some attempt to fortify London
Bridge by placing iron chains across the bridge;
and he gave orders for the drawbridge to be pulled
up, in order that a passage might be prevented.
But on Tyler’s threat that he would burn the bridge
if a way was not quickly made for him, Alderman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Sibley (who, with Aldermen Horne and Tonge,
supported the claims of the revolutionaries on the
City Corporation) had the chains removed and the
draw-bridge lowered, and Alderman Horne met
Tyler at the city gate and bade him welcome.</p>

<p>Fifty thousand men followed Tyler in London,
and the city was now at the mercy of the peasant
army. Walworth, who had no want of spirit, declared
to the king and his council in the Tower that
6,000 soldiers could be raised in the city, but “fear
had so fallen upon the soldiery that they seemed
half dead with fright.” Sir Robert Knolles with
600 men-at-arms guarded the Tower.</p>

<p>It was now that Wat Tyler’s great qualities of
leadership and the good discipline of his army were
seen. With London in his hands, he warned his
followers that death would be the instant punishment
for theft; and proclaimed to the citizens, “We
are indeed zealots for truth and justice, but we are
not thieves and robbers.” Every respect was to be
shown to the persons and property of the people of
London, and wrath was only to fall on John of
Gaunt and the ministers of the crown, and the
lawyers—the enemies, as it seemed to Tyler, of the
good estate of England. In return, the citizens
offered bread and ale freely to the invaders, and
London artisans joined their ranks in large
numbers.</p>

<p>The archbishop’s palace at Lambeth was soon
stormed, and all the records it contained were
destroyed; the building itself was left uninjured.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon the Savoy Palace of
John of Gaunt, by the Strand, was in flames; and
all its wealth of treasure, rich tapestries and costly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
furniture, rare vessels of gold and silver, precious
stones, and art work of priceless value, heaped up
on a bonfire or ground to powder. The Duke of
Lancaster’s jewelled coat, covered with gems, was
set up as a target and riddled with arrows, before it
was cut into a thousand pieces and pounded to dust.
One wretched man was caught attempting to sneak
off with a silver cup; and being taken in the act,
was put to death as Tyler had decreed. The Savoy
was burnt to the ground, but no one interfered with
its inhabitants; and Henry, Earl of Derby, John of
Gaunt’s son (who was to reign in Richard’s stead as
Henry IV.), passed out with all his servants unmolested.
The wine-cellar proved fatal to certain
of the host, who, drinking freely, perished, buried
under the fallen building.</p>

<p>From the Savoy the army of destruction passed
to the Temple, the head-quarters of the Knights
Hospitallers, of whom Sir Robert Hales was president,
and a hive of lawyers. The Temple was
burnt, but no lives were lost; for the lawyers, “even
the most aged and infirm of them, scrambled off with
the agility of rats or evil spirits.”</p>

<p>At nightfall the priory of the Hospitallers at
Clerkenwell, the prisons at the Fleet and at Newgate,
and the Manor House at Highbury, had all been
demolished; and the men of Essex, led by Thomas
Faringdon, a London baker, were at Mile End;
while William Grindcobbe, with a body of men from
St. Albans, lay at Highbury.</p>

<p>In vain Walworth urged the king and his
royal council to act. Richard had sent to Tyler
asking for a written statement of the grievances
of the commons, and had been told in reply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
that the king must meet his commons face to face,
and hear with his own ears their demands. In the
evening Walworth proposed that the garrison at
the Tower should be despatched against Tyler, “to
fall upon these wretches who were in the streets, and
amounted to 60,000, while they were asleep and
drunk. They might be killed like flies,” Walworth
added, “for not one in twenty had arms.”</p>

<p>But the handful of soldiers at the Tower were in
mortal terror of the peasant host, and “all had so
lost heart that you would have thought them more
like dead men than living.”</p>

<p>The Earl of Salisbury checked Walworth’s rash
proposals. “If we begin what we cannot carry
through,” he observed, “we shall never be able to
repair matters. It will be all over with us and our
heirs, and England will be a desert.”</p>

<p>An open conflict with Tyler and his 60,000 was
a very hazardous proceeding. Who could be sure
of escape if it came to battle? So far Tyler had
only struck at the chief ministers and the lawyers,
and why should others risk their lives in such a
quarrel? Besides, it was said that Wat Tyler and a
mad priest of Kent were for doing away with all
nobles, and for making all men equal, and caution was
necessary in dealing with men who held such strange
opinions. England without its nobility would be a
desert, and at all costs such an irreparable calamity
as the loss of England’s nobility must be prevented.</p>

<p>So Walworth got no help in his plans for resistance;
and when that night a messenger from Tyler
warned the king that if he refused to meet the
commons of England in open conference, the people
would seize the Tower, Richard sent word in reply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
promising to meet his subjects on the morrow at
noon at Mile End, and there hear their complaints.</p>

<p>Tyler accepted the king’s word, and after sleeping
with his men hard by the Tower, at St. Catherine’s
Wharf, was at Mile End betimes. Here he met
Grindcobbe, and hearing that the people of Hertfordshire
had trouble with the abbot at St. Albans,
bade Grindcobbe return and accomplish freedom for
the abbot’s tenants and serfs.</p>

<p>Richard went to Mile End with no large retinue,
and two of his companions, the Earl of Kent and
Sir John Holland, left him at Whitechapel and
galloped off in craven fear of the multitude that
thronged the road. Richard, though he was only
fifteen, displayed both courage and cunning when
confronted with Tyler. He knew that the discontent
in the country was directed against the government,
and not against the king, and that the misrule
could not fairly be laid to his charge. Besides, he
was the son of the Black Prince, and the people
showed no signs of hostility. His policy was to
yield and to wait an opportunity for regaining power.</p>

<p>The conference at Mile End began with a request
from Richard to know what was required of him.
Tyler answered that first all traitors should be executed,
and to this demand the king agreed. Then
four definite proposals were put forward by Wat
Tyler:</p>

<p>1. A free and general pardon to all concerned in
the rising.</p>

<p>2. The total abolition of all villeinage and serfdom.</p>

<p>3. An end to all tolls and market dues,—“freedom
to buy and sell in all cities, burghs, mercantile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
towns, and other places within our kingdom of
England.”</p>

<p>4. All customary tenants to be turned into lease-holders
whose rent should be fixed at 4d. an acre for
ever.</p>

<p>Richard at once assented to these requests, and to
prevent any uncertainty and remove all doubt or
suspicion of good faith, thirty clerks were set to work
on the spot to draw up charters of manumission,
and to present banners to each county represented.</p>

<p>Then Richard bade the people return home in
peace, bearing the king’s banner in token that the
king had granted the request of his subjects. One
or two from each village remained to carry the
charters of freedom signed and sealed by royal
warrant.</p>

<p>Richard was taken at his word. Thousands of
the peasants dispersed that day believing their cause
had triumphed. Nothing could be plainer than the
charters of manumission:—“Know that of our
special grace we have manumitted all our liege and
singular subjects and others of the county of Hertford,
freed each and all of their old bondage, and
made them quit by these presents; pardon them all
felonies, treasons, transgressions, and extortions committed
by any and all of them, and assure them of
our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">summa pax</i>.”</p>

<p>So ran the document which the peasants of Hertford
bore, and similar charters were given to the
counties of Bedford, Essex, Kent, and Surrey.</p>

<p>Richard was also taken at his word concerning
the execution of traitors, and by the authority of
Wat Tyler, Archbishop Sudbury, the chancellor, Sir
Robert Hales, the treasurer, and John Legge, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
poll-tax commissioner, were dragged out of the
Tower and beheaded on Tower Hill. When Richard
returned from Mile End the heads of these three
men were on the gate of London Bridge.</p>

<p>Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, deserved
a better fate, for he was an amiable and gentle
priest, and “lenient to heretics.” As chancellor he
shared the punishment of a government deservedly
hated, but there were many who deplored his death.</p>

<p>The soldiers at the Tower offered no resistance,
but joked and fraternised with the people.</p>

<p>(John of Gaunt’s chaplain, William Appleton,
some of Legge’s subordinates, and Richard Lyons
also perished that day on Tower Hill. Of these,
Richard Lyons was a thoroughly corrupt person,
who five years earlier had been convicted of gross
usury and of fraudulently “forestalling” in the wool
trade, and had escaped the penalty of the law on
being sentenced to pay a heavy fine and suffer imprisonment.
At one time he had been a member of
Edward III.’s council, and in that capacity had enriched
himself and his friends at the expense of the
nation.)</p>

<p>A cry was raised in London that night against
the Flemings, and many of these industrious aliens,
whose only offence was the employment of cheap
labour, were put to death, denied even the right of
sanctuary when they fled to the altar of the church
of the Austin Friars. The houses of certain unpopular
citizens were also fired, and it went hard
with all who refused to shout for “King Richard
and the Commons.”</p>

<p>But Tyler gave no sanction to the attack on the
Flemings, and though the London mob took the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
into its own hands and dealt roughly with those
whom it disliked, there is no evidence of general
rioting and disorder. To the end the peasant folk
in London remembered the brotherhood John Ball
had proclaimed, and respected their fellows, and
their good order is a lasting tribute to their leaders.</p>

<p>Tyler, with the bulk of the men of Kent and
Surrey, remained in the city, and the king hearing
of what had happened at the Tower, decided to pass
the night at the Wardrobe, by St. Paul’s, whither his
mother had gone when the Tower was invaded.</p>

<p>Tyler, in spite of all that had been obtained at
Mile End, was not satisfied. The peasants and
serfs had been freed by royal warrant, but the landlords
remained in possession of power, and there
was no promise of better government, no word as to
the restoration of the old common rights in the
land, or the repeal of the savage forest laws.
Reforms had been won, but the changes were not
strong enough to ensure a social revolution.</p>

<p>Once more, on the Saturday, June 15th, Richard
was invited to meet his subjects, and again he
declared his willingness, summoning his commons
by proclamation to meet him that afternoon at
Smithfield, in the square outside St. Bartholomew’s
Priory.</p>

<p>It seemed on the morning of June 15th as though
the rising had succeeded triumphantly. The peasants
had their charters of manumission, the nobles were
thoroughly alarmed and cowed, the soldiery powerless,
and Wat Tyler and his men still held the City
of London.</p>

<p>Holding such an advantage, Tyler determined to
make the king decree further reforms, and when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
two met at Smithfield, the confidence of victory could
be seen in the peasant leader’s bearing.</p>

<p>Richard, with two hundred retainers, and with
Henry, Earl of Derby, the Earls of Suffolk and
Salisbury, Sir Simon Burley, and Walworth, the
mayor, were on the east side of the square, the
great priory at their back.</p>

<p>Tyler and his army drew up on the west side,
and when Walworth opened the proceedings by
calling on Wat Tyler to speak with the king, Tyler,
seated on a little horse, rode out into the middle of
the square with a single attendant. There he dismounted,
dropped on one knee before the king, and
shook him heartily by the hand. He bade Richard
be of good cheer, and declared that within a fortnight
he should have even more thanks from the
commons than he had won already. “You and I
shall be good comrades yet,” Tyler added.</p>

<p>Richard, in some embarrassment, enquired why
the commons did not return home, and Tyler answered
with a great and solemn oath that no one
should leave the city until they had got a further
redressing of all their grievances. “And much the
worse will it be for the lords of this realm if this
charter be refused,” he concluded.</p>

<p>Then Richard bade Tyler say what charter it was
the commons demanded.</p>

<p>“First, then,” said Tyler, “let no law but the law
of Winchester prevail throughout the land, and let
no man be made an outlaw by the decree of judges
and lawyers.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> Grant also that no lord shall henceforth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
exercise lordship over the commons; and since
we are oppressed by so vast a horde of bishops and
clerks, let there be but one bishop in England; and
let the property and goods of the holy Church be
divided fairly according to the needs of the people in
each parish, after in justice making suitable provision
for the present clergy and monks. Finally, let
there be no more villeins in England, but grant us
all to be free and of one condition.”</p>

<p>“All that you have asked for I promise readily,”
Richard answered, “if only it be consistent with
the regality of my crown. And now let the commons
return home since their requests have been
granted.”</p>

<p>In the presence of his nobles and the hearing of
his people the king had promised that the demands
of his subjects should be granted.</p>

<p>For Wat Tyler the victory seemed complete, and
now that the battle was won he called out that he
was thirsty, and complained of a parched throat.
The days had been strenuous, and Tyler longed for
a draught of the good home-brewed beer of his
native county. His attendant brought him water,
and Tyler rinsed out his mouth with it, to the disgust
of the king’s courtiers. Then beer was brought in
a mighty tankard, and Tyler drank a deep draught
to the health of “King Richard and the Commons.”
He remounted his little horse, while the nobles stood
by in silent and sullen anger, “for no lord or counsellor
dared to open his mouth and give an answer
to the commons in such a situation.” Had they not
heard it proclaimed that henceforth all were to be
free and equal in the land?</p>

<p>A “valet of Kent,” some knight in the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
service, broke silence, muttering loudly his opinion
that Wat Tyler was the greatest thief and robber
in all Kent.</p>

<p>Tyler caught the abusive words, and immediately
ordered his attendant to cut down the man who had
spoken in this insulting fashion.</p>

<p>The “valet” edged back within the ranks of the
king’s party, and Tyler drew his dagger. Walworth,
sharing to the full the rage of the nobles at the
capitulation of the king, and yet anxious to avoid a
conflict, shouted that he would arrest all those who
drew weapons in the royal presence. Tyler struck
impatiently at Walworth, but the blow was harmless,
for the mayor had armour on beneath his jerkin.</p>

<p>Before Tyler could defend himself the mayor
retaliated. Drawing a short cutlass he slashed at
Tyler, wounding him in the neck so that he fell
from his horse. And with the fall of their leader fell
all the promised liberties of the peasants, and the
rising collapsed.</p>

<p>Two knights, Ralph Standish and another, plunged
their swords into him while he was on the ground.
Still, mortally wounded though he was, Tyler
managed to scramble on to his little horse. He
rode a yard or two, gave a last call on the commons
to avenge his death, and then dropped to the ground
to rise no more.</p>

<p>Had the commons at once attacked the king’s
party, they would have conquered. But confusion
fell upon the people, and there was no one ready to
take command. “Let us stand together,” “We will
die with our captain or avenge him,” “Shoot, lads,
shoot,”—the various cries went up, and the bowmen
looked to their weapons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>But Richard, with the presence of mind that
marked his dealings with the people at Mile End,
turned the doubt and uncertainty to his own advantage.
He rode out boldly into the middle of the
square, reminded the people that he, and not Tyler,
was their king, and bade them follow him into the
fields and receive their charters.</p>

<p>There was no reason to refuse obedience, no
reason to mistrust the king. Tyler had always
spoken well of Richard, and the people themselves
had seen him only yesterday sign their charters, and
had heard him in Tyler’s presence, only a few
minutes ago, promise to do the will of the commons.
It was not by the king’s hand that their leader had
been slain.</p>

<p>A small band carried Tyler’s body into the Priory
of St. Bartholomew, while the rest of the peasants
followed Richard into the fields that stretched from
Clerkenwell to Islington. Here he held them until
Sir Robert Knolles arrived with 700 soldiers, for
Walworth had lost no time in spreading the news
that Tyler was dead, and in raising a troop for the
king. By Richard’s orders the commons were dispersed
when the soldiery arrived, the men of Kent,
now broken and dispirited, being marched through
the city, and left to take their way home.</p>

<p>That very night Walworth and Standish were
knighted for what they had done, and in the morning
Wat Tyler’s head stared horribly from London
Bridge.</p>

<p>“My son, what sorrow I have suffered for thee
this day,” cried the king’s mother, when Richard
came to the Wardrobe.</p>

<p>“I know it well, madam,” answered the king;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
“but rejoice with me now, and thank God that I
have this day won back my heritage of England,
so nearly lost.”</p>

<p>The great uprising was over. Wat Tyler had
fallen, as it seemed, in the very hour of victory.</p>

<p>By Walworth’s orders, Jack Straw and two prominent
men of Kent were hanged on the night of
June 15th, without the formality of trial. Jack
Straw, an itinerant priest sharing John Ball’s views,
it is said, explained before he died what had been in
the minds of the leaders of the revolt. They had
meant to get rid of the supremacy of the landlords
altogether, and to substitute for the established
clergy a voluntary ministry of mendicant friars; the
boy-king was to be enlisted in the cause of the
revolution before the monarchy was finally abolished;
and in place of parliament and royal council each
county was to enjoy self-government.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>No longer in the presence of danger, the king and
his ministers struck fiercely at the rebels.</p>

<p>On June 18th a general proclamation was issued
ordering the arrest of all malefactors and the dispersal
of all unruly gatherings. On June 22nd,
Chief Justice Sir Robert Tressilian went on assize,
and “showed mercy to none and made great havock.”
John Ball was taken at Coventry and, with Grindcobbe,
hanged at St. Albans on July 15th.</p>

<p>The Earl of Suffolk went down to Suffolk with
500 lances on June 23rd, and John Wraw, with
twenty others, including four beneficed clergy, was
quickly taken and hanged. Henry Despenser,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Bishop of Norwich, grandson of Edward III.’s
minister, suppressed the rising in Norfolk, and
walked beside Litster to the gallows.</p>

<p>At least a thousand peasant lives were sacrificed
to the law under Tressilian’s sentence.</p>

<p>At Waltham a deputation came to Richard to ask
if it were true that the royal promises and charters
were annulled, and the king’s answer left no room
for doubt, for it breathed all the hatred and contempt
of the commons that Tyler had striven to end:</p>

<p>“O vile and odious by land and sea, you who are
not worthy to live when compared with the lords
whom ye have attacked; you should be forthwith
punished with the vilest deaths were it not for the
office ye bear. Go back to your comrades and bear
the king’s answer. You were and are rustics, and
shall remain in bondage, not that of old, but in one
infinitely worse. For as long as we live, and by
God’s help rule over this realm, we will attempt by
all our faculties, powers, and means to make you
such an example of offence to the heirs of your
servitude as that they may have you before their
eyes, and you may supply them with a perpetual
ground for cursing and fearing you.”</p>

<p>In despair at this rough ending to all their
cherished hopes of freedom, the Essex peasants
made a last attempt to fight for liberty, and on
June 28th, at Great Baddow and Billericay, more
than 500 fell before the king’s soldiery.</p>

<p>On July 2nd all the charters of manumission and
royal pardons were declared formally annulled,
and sheriffs were strictly forbidden to release any
prisoners. It was not till August 30th an amnesty
was granted to those suspected of taking part in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
rising. In the autumn parliament refused to ratify
the charters, and the lawyers declared that without
the consent of parliament the charters were illegal.</p>

<p>So there was an end to all Wat Tyler and the
peasants had risen to obtain, and well might it seem
that the rising had been in vain.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>Yet it was not altogether in vain that John Ball
had rung his bell and died for his faith, that Wat
Tyler had led the peasant folk of Kent to do battle
for freedom. The poll-tax was stopped for one
thing. And villeinage was doomed. “The landlords
gave up the practice of demanding base
services; they let their lands to leasehold tenants,
and accepted money payments in lieu of labour;
they ceased to recall the emancipated labourer into
serfdom or to oppose his assertion of right in the
courts of the manor and the county.” (W. Stubbs.)</p>

<p>The great uprising brought out the desire for
personal liberty in the labouring people of England
that has never since been utterly quenched. It was
the first insistence that peasants and serfs were men
of England. “It taught the king’s officers and
gentle folks that they must treat the peasants like
men if they wished them to behave quietly, and
it led most landlords to set free their bondsmen,
and to take fixed money payments instead of uncertain
services from their customary tenants, so
that in a hundred years’ time there were very few
bondsmen left in England.” (F. York Powell.)</p>

<p>If Wat Tyler died as a man should for the cause
he loves, few of those who trampled on the cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the peasants were to know the paths of peace in
later years.</p>

<p>Richard died in prison at the hands of Henry
Bolingbroke, John of Gaunt’s son, whom Tyler had
let depart in safety when the Savoy was in flames.
The Earls of Suffolk and Warwick died exiled
fugitives. The Earl of Salisbury, fleeing from
Henry V., was hanged in the streets of Cirencester.
Chief Justice Tressilian was hanged for a traitor in
1387, and Sir Simon Burley was beheaded.</p>

<h3 class="left">JACK CADE, THE<br />
CAPTAIN OF KENT
<span class="subhead">1450</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> rising of the commons of Kent in 1450
under their captain, Jack Cade, was the
protest of people—sick of the misrule at
home and of the mismanagement of affairs
abroad—driven to take up arms against an incapable
government that would not heed gentler measures.</p>

<p>It was not such a peasant revolt as Wat Tyler
had led, this rising of the fifteenth century. It was
largely the work of men of some local importance,
and country squires were active in enrolling men,
employing the parish constable for that purpose in a
good many parishes.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>For years discontent had been rife. Henry VI., a
weak, religious man, more fit for the cloister than
the throne, had lost the great statesmen of the early
years of his reign. The Duke of Bedford, good
Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, and Cardinal Beaufort
were all dead, and Richard, Duke of York, by
far the ablest man left among the nobles, had been
banished to the government of Ireland. The Duke
of Suffolk became the chief minister of the crown in
1445, and all the disasters of the war in France and
of corrupt maladministration in England were laid at
his door. Suffolk was responsible for the king’s
marriage with the penniless princess, Margaret of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Anjou, who, ambitious and self-willed, proved the
worst possible counsellor for Henry. And the price
of this marriage was the territories of Anjou and
Maine, which were ceded to Margaret’s father,
besides a heavy tax of one-fifteenth of all incomes
demanded by Suffolk in payment for his expenses in
arranging and carrying out the undesirable wedding.
The years of Suffolk’s ministry saw nothing but
defeat and disgrace as the hundred years’ war with
France drew to its end. The victories of Edward
III. and Henry V., and all the wealth of life and
treasure poured out so lavishly by England, had
come to nothing, and by 1451 all France save Calais
was lost. Popular discontent turned to action early
in 1450 against Suffolk and his fellow ministers. At
the opening of parliament Suffolk was impeached as
a traitor, along with Lord Say-and-Sele, the treasurer,
and Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury; and
Suffolk, without even demanding a trial by his peers,
threw himself on the king’s mercy. Henry was
satisfied with the banishment of his fallen minister
for five years; but when Suffolk went on board, the
sailors of the vessel that was to take him across seas
decreed a capital sentence, and after a rough court-martial
trial the Duke of Suffolk was beheaded on
May 2nd in a small boat off the coast of Dover, and
his body left on the sands. Four months earlier,
Moleyns, Bishop of Chichester, who had only just
resigned the keepership of the Privy Seal, and was
known as a supporter of Suffolk’s, had been slain by
the sailors of Portsmouth, when he arrived at that
town with arrears of pay long overdue to the troops.
Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury, survived till the end
of June, and then, at the time when Cade was marching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
on London, he was dragged away from the very
altar of Erdington Church, in Wiltshire, when he
had said mass, and put to death on a hill there by
the infuriated people of his diocese.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Widespread as the discontent was in 1450, there
was no general movement throughout the land as
in the days when John Ball and his companions
bound the peasants together by village clubs. Kent,
“impatient in wrongs, disdaining of too much
oppression, and ever desirous of new change
and new fangleness,” was well organised for
revolt, and the men of Surrey and Sussex were
ready to bear arms with Cade. Outside these
counties no one is found to have taken the lead
against the government. Kent and Sussex had
their own reasons for revolt, for piracy swept the
English Channel unchecked, and the highways were
infested with robbers—soldiers broken in the war;
and they had their leader—Mortimer, whom some
called “John Mendall” and others, later, Jack Cade.
So by the end of May a full list of grievances and
necessary reforms was drawn up, and the commons
of Kent had, for the second time in history, risen in
arms and encamped on Blackheath, resolute to get
redress from the king for their injuries.</p>

<p>The success of democratic revolt depends largely
on the clear courage of its leaders and the complete
confidence of the people in those they elect for their
captains. In 1450 Jack Cade proved himself both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
clear-headed and brave, and the men of Kent followed
him whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>To this day we are still in the dark as to the real
name and family of the Captain of Kent. He was
known popularly as “Mortimer,” and was so described
in the “pardon” he received. He was a
man of some property, or he would not have been
attainted by special act of parliament, nor have
enjoyed the confidence of the men of substance who
accepted his generalship. He was known as an
Irishman and as a soldier in the French wars, and it
is likely enough that he served under the Duke of
York both in France and Ireland. His strong
advocacy of the claims of York favours the notion of
kinsmanship; but, on the other hand, York was by
far the ablest statesman of the day, and to demand
his recall to the king’s council was no guarantee of
family motives.</p>

<p>There was some talk at the time that Cade was
called John Aylesmere, and that he was married to
the daughter of a Surrey squire at Taundede. But
there is no more evidence for these things than for
the charges made against him in the warrant for his
arrest, that he had once killed a woman in Sussex
and had then fled to France and fought with the
French arms.</p>

<p>The undisputed high character of Cade’s followers
is all against the portrait painted by the government
after his death; when, anxious to blacken the good
name of so resolute a leader, it was made out that
he was merely a disreputable ruffian. The landowners
of Kent and Sussex would never have
accepted for their captain a mere swashbuckling
blackguard. They rallied to him as a Mortimer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
seeing in him a likeness to Richard, Duke of York.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
If his real name was Cade, then he was probably a
squire or yeoman, for Cade was no uncommon name
round Mayfield and Heathfield in Sussex, and Cades
were landed proprietors near Reigate as late as the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>It was enough that, chosen Captain of Kent, Cade,
or Mortimer, was known and trusted as a brave,
upright man of good character and ability.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
Whether descended from nobles or of good Sussex
stock was a small matter to men in earnest for the
changes and reforms the country needed.</p>

<p>Ashford was the heart of the rising, and from
Ashford the host marched to Blackheath, where, at
the beginning of June, the camp was fixed. The
army, estimated at 46,000, included 18 esquires, 74
county gentlemen, and some five clerks in holy
orders, who were presently joined by the Abbot of
Battle, the Prior of Lewes, and twenty-three county
gentlemen from Sussex.</p>

<p>Cade at once explained that they must deal
directly with the king if they were to get relief from
their present burdens, and then set to work to draw
up the bill of “the complaint and requests” of the
commons of Kent, while the rank and file laboured
“to dyke and stake the camp all about, as it had
been in the land of war.”</p>

<p>But war had not yet been declared, and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
present discipline was loose in the camp at Blackheath.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
“As good was Jack Robin as John at the
Noke, for all were as high as pig’s feet; until the
time that they should come and speak with such
states and messengers as were sent unto them.
Then they put all their power into the man that was
named captain of all their host.”</p>

<p>On June 7th the king was at Smithfield with
20,000 soldiers, and messengers were promptly
despatched to Blackheath to know the meaning of
the insurrection. Cade answered by showing the
petition he had drawn up, and mentioned that they
had assembled “to redress and reform the wrongs
that were done in the realm, and to withstand the
malice of them that were destroyers of the common
profit, and to correct and amend the defaults of them
that were the king’s chief counsellors.” He then
sent off the “bill of complaints” to the king and to
the parliament then sitting at Westminster, “and
requested to have answer thereof again, but answer
he had none.” The “complaint” was received with
contempt, and the opinion of the king’s counsellors
was that “such proud rebels should rather be suppressed
and tamed with violence and force than with
fair words or amicable answer.”</p>

<p>Yet “the complaint,” which consisted of fifteen
articles, was no revolutionary document. It contained
protests against the royal threat to lay waste
Kent in revenge for the death of the Duke of
Suffolk; the diversion of the royal revenue raised
by heavy taxation to “other men”; the banishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
of the Duke of York “to make room for unworthy
ministers who would not do justice by law, but
demanded bribes and gifts”; the purveyance of
goods for the royal household without payment; the
arrest and imprisonment on false charges of treason
of persons whose goods and lands were subsequently
seized by the king’s servants, who then “either compassed
their deaths or kept them in prison while they
got possession of their property by royal grant”;
the interference with the old right of free election of
knights of the shire by “the great rulers of the
country sending letters to enforce their tenants and
other people to choose other persons than the
common will is to elect”; the misconduct of the war
in France, demanding inquiry and the punishment by
law of those found guilty. Complaint was also
made of various local grievances—the insecurity of
property, the arbitrary conduct of the lords of the
seaports, the extortion in taxation owing to sheriffs
and under-sheriffs farming their offices, the fines
exacted by sheriffs for non-compliance with the
orders of the court of exchequer (whose writs were
sealed with green wax) when no summons or warning
had been given, and the “sore expense” incurred
by there being only one Court of Sessions in
the whole county.</p>

<p>Five “requests” were added to the bill of complaints.
These expressed the desire of the commons
that the king should reign “like a king royal”; that
“all the false progeny and affinity of the Duke
of Suffolk” should be banished from the king’s
presence and brought to trial, and the Duke of York
and his friends included in the royal council; that
punishment should be meted out to those responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
for the death of the Duke of Gloucester; that the
extortions practised daily by the king’s servants in
the taking of goods from the people should cease;
that the old Statute of Labourers for keeping down
wages should be abolished; and that the “false
traitors” and “great extortioners,” Lord Say and
Crowmer, the sheriff of Kent, should be brought low.</p>

<p>In brief, the charter of the commons of Kent
demanded the total expulsion of all Suffolk’s
ministers and relatives from public service, the
return of the Duke of York and his party to power,
the suppression of the bribery, corruption, and
extortion practised by the sheriffs and government
servants, and the repeal of the Statute of Labourers.</p>

<p>It would have been well if Henry had heeded
these complaints and requests. As it was he pushed
on to Blackheath, in spite of murmuring in his army,
and Cade, unwilling to risk a battle, and knowing
that disaffection was at work in London, quietly
withdrew to Sevenoaks. There was no spirit in the
royal troops to suppress the rising, and many
favoured the Captain of Kent. But two knights,
Sir Humfrey Stafford and Sir William Stafford,
kinsmen of the Duke of Buckingham and the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and men of some military
repute, decided to pursue the rebels and advanced to
Sevenoaks with a small picked body of soldiers.
Their defeat was complete. Both knights were
slain, and those of their men who were not cut to
pieces fled from the battle, or joined Cade’s host.</p>

<p>The result of this disaster to the royal plans was
that Henry returned to London with an army that
soon melted away, or broke into open disorder.
Many of the nobles, who on receipt of the petition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the commons of Kent had called for violent measures
against the rebels, now left the king, and, with their
retainers, rode to their country estates. Henry, to
appease the clamour of some of his own followers,
ordered the arrest of Lord Say-and-Sele, the king’s
treasurer, and of Sheriff Crowmer, and bade officers
take them to the Tower. Parliament was dissolved,
and Cade was busy in Kent gathering reinforcements,
and doing what he could to repair locally
the mischief of Suffolk’s rule before proceeding to
London.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>As a last resource, Henry decided to treat with
Cade by ambassadors, and on June 29th, when the
commons were again encamped on Blackheath, came
the Duke of Buckingham, and Stafford, Archbishop
of Canterbury, for many years the king’s
chancellor—a gentle old man, who, if he had made
no stand against the misgovernment himself, was
hardly to be blamed—to arrange, if possible, a
peaceful settlement.</p>

<p>The conference came to nothing, for neither
Buckingham nor the archbishop could promise Cade
any positive redress of grievances, or the interview
he sought with the king.</p>

<p>“These lords found him sober in talk, wise in
reasoning, arrogant in heart, and stiff in opinions;
one who that by no means would dissolve his
army, except the king in person would come to
him, and assent to the things he would require”
(Holinshed.)</p>

<p>The failure of the mission was reported, and
Henry, after appointing Lord Scales as guardian of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the prisoners in the Tower, hastily fled to Kenilworth,
although the lord mayor and citizens of
London promised to stand by him if he would
remain in the city. There was little of sovereignty
in Henry VI., son of Henry V., the conqueror of
Agincourt. Quiet he loved, and in religious exercises
he found the satisfaction that others found in war
and statecraft.</p>

<p>On the first of July the way was open for the
commons to enter London. Suffolk, Bishop
Moleyns, and Bishop Ayscough had all been
summarily executed. Lord Say, the treasurer,
alone remained of the discredited ministers. No
opposition was offered to Cade by the citizens of
London. The Common Council had discussed the
rising, and at the Guildhall only one dissentient
voice had been raised to the admission of the
Captain of Kent to the city. One Horne, a stockfishmonger
and alderman, alone objected to any
recognition of the unlawful assembly of the commons,
and he was sent to Newgate prison for safety,
and on Cade’s entry fined 500 marks for his daring
speech.</p>

<p>Negotiations had been opened between the City
Council and the commons while the latter were at
Blackheath, and Thomas Cocke (or Cooke),<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> a past
warden of the Drapers’ Company, acted as the
mutual friend of both parties. From Cocke the
corporation learnt of Cade’s purposes, and that the
city stood in no danger from the rising; and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
Cocke who carried instructions from Cade to the
wealthy foreign merchants, requiring them to furnish
horses, arms and money for his army.</p>

<p>“Ye shall charge all Lombards and strangers,
being merchants, Genoese, Venetians, Florentines and
others this day to draw them together: and to ordain
for us, the captain, twelve [sets of] harness complete,
of the best fashion, twenty-four brigandines, twelve
battle-axes, twelve glaves, six horses with saddle
and bridle completely harnessed, and 1,000 marks of
ready money.”</p>

<p>So ran the summons, which was duly obeyed.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
For Cade had added the stern warning that “if this
demand be not observed and done, we shall have the
heads of as many as we can get of them.”</p>

<p>The corporation had really no choice but to welcome
Cade. Kings and nobles had fled, and here
was the Captain of Kent with 50,000 men come to
do justice at their gates. London had suffered as
badly as any place from the misgovernment of the
country, and it was plain the commons of Kent were
no army of maurauders, for no complaint had been
heard of their ill doing in Kent, and their captain
had treated with full civility the Duke of Buckingham
and Archbishop Stafford.</p>

<p>So the keys of the city were presented to Cade,
and at five o’clock on the 2nd of July the Captain of
Kent, mounted on a good horse, rode across London
Bridge, followed by all his army. In Cannon Street,
in the presence of Sir John Chalton, the Lord
Mayor, and a great multitude of people, Cade laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
down his sword on the old London Stone and declared
proudly, “Now is Mortimer lord of this city.”
At nightfall he returned to his headquarters, the
White Hart, a famous inn in Southwark, and next
morning was betimes in the city. That day sentence
was passed on Lord Say-and-Sele and on his son-in-law,
Sheriff Crowmer. They were removed from the
Tower by Cade’s orders, taken to the Guildhall,
tried and condemned for “divers treasons,” and for
“certain extortions,” and executed forthwith. Say
was beheaded at the standard in Cheapside, and
Crowmer at Mile End, and so bitter was the public
feeling against these two men, and so fierce the
popular hatred, that their heads were carried on
poles through the city, and made to kiss in ghastly
embrace before being placed on London Bridge.</p>

<p>These, with a third man named John Bailey, who
was hanged with Cade’s permission for being a
necromancer and a dabbler in magic and the black
arts, were the only persons put to death while Mortimer
was lord of the city. At Southwark, where
the commons were now encamped, as at Blackheath,
theft in the popular army was treated as a capital
offence, and two or three “lawless men” were
hanged. It was inevitable if discipline and good
order were to be obtained in so vast a company that
punishment should follow sharp and swift on all who
brought discredit on the rising.</p>

<p>Lord Say and Sheriff Crowmer being dead, the
city fathers saw no further purpose in Cade’s lordship,
and they dreaded being called upon to contribute
to the support of his army, for they knew that
Cade needed money for his men. To the everlasting
credit of the commons no charge was laid against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
them of riot or disorder. The city was in their
hands for three days, yet no harm befell the citizens.
On their captain alone has blame fallen for the
events of those days in July.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the man were immense. He
had rendered no mean service to the state by calling
attention to the ills that plagued the country, and
proposing remedies. He had roused a large body of
Englishmen to demand a better government, and by
the sharp method of the times he had got rid of a
bad minister and a corrupt sheriff, so that public life
was at least the healthier for the deliverance from two
of its oppressors. And now he had this army of 50,000
men, all needing food and shelter—an orderly, well-disciplined
body, no mob of mercenaries—and the
city of London, with all its wealth, gave him nothing.</p>

<p>Cade had to get supplies. The commons of Kent
could not live on the good will of the London people.
Their captain was forced to levy toll where he could.
At present all he had received was the tribute from
the foreign merchants and 500 marks from the fishmonger
Horne.</p>

<p>On July 3rd, the night of Say’s execution, Cade
supped with Philip Malpas, Cocke’s father-in-law.
Malpas was one of Suffolk’s party, a King Henry’s
man, unpopular in the city, and though an alderman
and a draper, an expelled member of the city council.
Warned by Cocke, Malpas got rid of his valuables
before Cade arrived. But the Captain of Kent
found certain jewels belonging to the Duke of York
in the house, and these he carried off.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>The following night Cade supped with a merchant
named Curtis (Ghirstis according to Fabyan, Girste
according to Stow) in the parish of St. Margaret
Pattens and before he left insisted on a contribution
to the war chest. Curtis paid, but he resented
bitterly the abuse of his hospitality. It seemed to
him, as it seemed to his fellow merchants to whom
he told the tale of his wrongs, sheer robbery, and
the following morning (Sunday, July 5th), while
Cade rested quietly at the White Hart in Southwark,
the city fathers were busy shaking their heads
over the business, and grave anxiety filled their
minds. This might be but the beginning of pillage;
there were always materials in London for a riot,
apart from Cade’s army.</p>

<p>“And for this the hearts of the citizens fell from
him, and every thrifty man was afraid to be served
in like wise, for there was many a man in London
that awaited and would fain have seen a common
robbery” (Stow.)<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>In the course of the day mayor and corporation
were in consultation with Lord Scales, the Governor
of the Tower, with the result that decision was made
to prevent Cade and the commons from re-entering
the city. London Bridge was at once seized and
fortified by the citizens, and Matthew Gough, a distinguished
soldier in the French wars, was placed in
command.</p>

<p>Cade, knowing nothing of the hostility he had
created, took his ease that day—it was the last
peaceful Sabbath he was to know. Towards evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
he gave orders for the King’s Bench and Marshalsea
prisons to be opened, and their inmates—for
the most part victims of official extortion and injustice—to
be released. This was done, and certain
“lawless men” convicted of disobedience were haled
off to be hanged; to the end there was no relaxing
of discipline.</p>

<p>Then came word that the passage of London
Bridge was stopped, and the right of entry to the
city barred against the commons as against a foe.
Cade took this as a declaration of war, of the civil
war he had done his best to prevent, and sallied out
to force an entrance. At nine o’clock the battle
began on the bridge, and all through the short
summer night it raged, neither side effecting victory.
“For some time the Londoners were beat back to
the stulpes at St. Magnus corner, and suddenly
again the rebels were repulsed and driven back to
the stulpes at Southwark.” It was not till nine
o’clock on Monday morning that the commons,
wearied and disheartened, fell back from the fray,
and Cade understood that the attack had failed, and
that for the first time since the assembling of the
people on Blackheath, at the end of May, a check
had been given to the democratic movement. A
hasty truce was settled between Cade and the mayor,
that while the truce lasted the commons should not
cross into London nor the citizens into Southwark.
Cardinal Kemp, Archbishop of York, the king’s
chancellor, who with old Archbishop Stafford had
been left undisturbed in the Tower since the king’s
ignominious flight, immediately decided that the
time had come to arrange a settlement with the
Captain of Kent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>Kemp sent messengers that day to the White
Hart, asking Cade to meet the representatives of the
king, “to the end that the civil commotions and disturbances
might cease and tranquility be restored,”
and Cade consented.</p>

<p>Kemp, who had himself presided at the trial and
condemnation of Suffolk, brought to the conference,
which was held in the church of St. Margaret,
Southwark,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> on July 7th, Archbishop Stafford and
William Waynfleet, Bishop of Winchester. The
chancellor, bent on making peace, also brought
pardons to all concerned, duly signed and sealed.
He listened courteously to Cade’s “complaints” and
“requests,” received the petition, promised it should
have the full consideration of parliament, and then
announced a full pardon to all who should return home.</p>

<p>The proposals of the bishops won the general
approval of the commons. There was nothing to be
gained, it seemed, by remaining in arms, now they
had won a promise that their charter should come
before parliament.</p>

<p>Cade alone hesitated. What if parliament should
disavow these “pardons,” and the commons be
treated as the peasants were treated when they
trusted a king’s word? He asked for the endorsement
of his own pardon, and the pardons of his
followers, by parliament before his army dispersed.
Chancellor Kemp explained that this was impossible,
because parliament was dissolved. The people were
satisfied with the cardinal’s word. The rising was
at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>The following day the bulk of the commons
departed from Southwark for their farms and
cottages in Kent and Surrey and Sussex. Cade
watched them go. His own mind was made up.
Not till parliament should give him a pardon of
indisputable legality would he lay down his arms.
With a small band of followers he set off for
Rochester, sending what goods and provisions he
had by water.</p>

<p>The rising was at an end, and nothing more was
heard in parliament, or elsewhere, of the famous
charter of “complaints” and “requests.”</p>

<p>With the break-up of the insurgent army, the
government woke to activity. Alexander Iden was
appointed sheriff of Kent, and marrying Crowmer’s
widow, subsequently gained considerable profit.
Within a week the king’s writ and proclamation,
declaring John Cade a false traitor, was posted
throughout the countryside, and Cade, defeated in
an attempt to get possession of Queenborough
Castle, was a fugitive with the reward of 1,000
marks on his head, alive or dead, and with Sheriff
Iden in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>Near Heathfield, in Sussex, Iden came up with
his prey, early on Monday, July 13th.</p>

<p>Cade died fighting. A broken man, worn and
famished, friendless and alone, he still had his
sword. The spirit of Mortimer, Captain of Kent,
flickered up in the presence of his enemies—it were
better to die sword in hand fighting for freedom
than to perish basely by the hangman. So Cade
fought his last fight in the Sussex garden, and fell
mortally wounded, overpowered by the sheriff and
his men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>In all haste Iden sent off the dead body to
London; it was identified by the hostess of the
White Hart, and three days later the head was
stuck on London Bridge. The body was quartered
and portions sent to Blackheath, Norwich, Salisbury,
and Gloucester, for public exposure. The sheriffs of
London, upon whom the gruesome task fell of
despatching these remains, complained bitterly of
the cost of this proceeding, “because that hardly any
persons durst nor would take upon them the carriage
for doubt of their lives.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>Iden got his 1,000 marks reward, besides getting
the governorship of Rochester Castle, at a salary of
£36 per annum.</p>

<p>Cade was “attainted of treason” by act of parliament,
and all his goods, lands, and tenements made
forfeit to the crown. A year later another act of
parliament made void all that had been done by
Cade’s authority during the rising.</p>

<p>In January, 1451, Henry VI. went into Kent with
his justices, and this royal visitation was known as
the harvest of heads; for in spite of Cardinal
Kemp’s pardons, twenty-six men of Canterbury and
Rochester implicated in the rising were hanged.</p>

<p>So the last echoes of the rising died away, and
corruption and misgovernment remained. But the
commons of Kent and their captain had done what
they could, and in the only way that seemed possible,
to get justice done, and their failure was without
dishonour.</p>

<h3 class="left">SIR THOMAS MORE AND THE<br />
FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE

<span class="subhead">1529–1535.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">“Did</span> Nature ever frame a sweeter, happier
character than that of More?”—so
Erasmus wrote in 1498, when Thomas
More was twenty, and Erasmus, recently
come to England, some ten years older. It was
at the beginning of their friendship, a friendship
that was to last unbroken till death,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and More had
then passed from the household of Cardinal Morton
to Oxford, and from Oxford to Lincoln’s Inn, to
take up his father’s calling and follow the law as a
barrister.</p>

<p>Twenty years later Erasmus, writing at length to
Ulrich von Hutten, gives us a portrait of More in
full manhood. Temperance, simplicity, human
affection, good humour, independence of mind—these
qualities are conspicuous.</p>

<p>“I never saw anyone so indifferent about food.
Until he was a young man he delighted in drinking
water, but that was natural to him. Yet, that he
might not seem to be singular or unsociable, he
would conceal his temperance from his guests by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
drinking the lightest beer, or often pure water, out
of a pewter vessel.”</p>

<p>“He prefers milk diet and fruits, and is especially
fond of eggs. He would rather eat corned beef and
coarse bread than what are called delicacies.”</p>

<p>“He likes a simple dress, using neither silk nor
purple nor chains of gold—except on state occasions.
It is wonderful how careless he is of all that ceremony
which most men identify with politeness.
He neither requires it from others nor is anxious
to use it himself, though when it is necessary, at
interviews or banquets, he knows how to employ
it. But he thinks it unmanly to waste time over
such trifles.”</p>

<p>“He seems born and fashioned for friendship, and
is a most faithful and enduring friend. He is easy of
access to all; but if he chances to get familiar with
one whose vices will not brook correction, rather
than a sudden breaking off, he gradually relaxes the
intimacy and quietly drops it. He abhors games of
tennis, dice, cards, and the like, by which most
gentlemen kill time. Though he is rather too negligent
of his own interests, no one is more diligent in
behalf of his friends. So polite, and so sweet-mannered
is he in company, that no one is too
melancholy to be cheered by him. Since boyhood
he has always so delighted in merriment that it seems
to be part of his nature; yet his merriment is never
turned into buffoonery.”</p>

<p>“No one is less led by the opinions of the crowd,
yet no one is less eccentric.”</p>

<p>The friendship of More and Erasmus had ripened
in those twenty years. In More’s house, and at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
instigation, Erasmus had written the <cite>Praise of
Folly</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> and the great scholar watched with warm
interest the famous career and the brilliant character
of the man he loved so heartily.</p>

<p>More was already high in Henry VIII.’s favour
when Erasmus could write that no one was less led by
the opinions of the crowd, and more than once his
independence and courage of mind had been proved
in the twenty years that had passed.</p>

<p>Drawn at first to the monastic life, More had
spent four years (1500–1504) with the Carthusians
in Smithfield, “frequenting daily their spiritual
exercises, but without any vow.” Then it is plain
to him that his vocation is not the priesthood, but
marriage and public life, and he leaves the Charterhouse,
and in 1505 is married and in Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
But all his life the devotion to religion, and to the
services of the Church, remain in More, and he is
ascetic in the mortifications of the body till the spirit
and the will ride supreme.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons More stood out against
the exactions of Henry VII., and at once fell under
the king’s displeasure.</p>

<p>More’s son-in-law, Roper, tells the story:</p>

<p>“In the time of King Henry the Seventh, More
was made a burgess of the Parliament wherein was
demanded by the king (as I have heard reported)
about three-fifteenths, for the marriage of his eldest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
daughter, that then should be Scottish Queen; at
the last debating whereof he made such arguments
and reasons against, that the king’s demands were
thereby overthrown. So that one of the king’s privy
chamber being present thereat, brought word to the
king out of the Parliament house that a beardless boy
had disappointed all his purpose. Whereupon the
king, conceiving great indignation towards him,
could not be satisfied until he had some way
revenged it. And forasmuch as he, nothing have,
nothing could lose, his Grace devised a causeless
quarrel against his father, keeping him in the Tower
till he had made him pay a hundred pounds fine....
Had not the king soon after died, Sir
Thomas More was determined to have gone over
sea, thinking that being in the king’s indignation, he
could not live in England without great danger.”</p>

<p>The grant from parliament to the king was reduced
from £113,000 to £30,000 by More’s action; and if
this action brought royal anger, it won for More the
confidence of his fellow-citizens in London, so that
we see him in the second year of Henry VIII. under-sheriff
for the city, and according to Erasmus and
Roper, the most popular lawyer of the day. With
all his legal business, and good income, More is
never anxious after money. “While he was still
dependent on his fees, he gave to all true and
friendly counsel, considering their interests rather
than his own; he persuaded many to settle with
their opponents as the cheaper course. If he could
not induce them to act in that manner—for some
men delight in litigation—he would still indicate the
method that was least expensive.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>More’s rising reputation was bound to attract the
notice of Henry VIII., for the king was alert in the
early years of his reign to get good men at the
court, and Wolsey, who had become chancellor on
Archbishop Warham’s retirement in 1515, was
anxious to enlist More in the royal service. The
court had no attractions for More, his embassies to
Flanders and Calais, to settle trade disputes and
difficulties with France, wearied him, and in 1516 he
was engaged in finishing his <cite>Utopia</cite>. According
to Roper, it was More’s independence of mind that
made the king force office at court upon him. A
ship belonging to the pope, which had put into
Southampton, was claimed by Henry as a forfeiture.
More argued the case so clearly that the commissioners
decided in the pope’s favour, and the king at
once declared he must have More in his service.</p>

<p>Then for the next twelve years Sir Thomas More
enjoyed the royal favour and friendship. His promotion
was rapid. Secretary of state, master of
requests when the king was travelling, privy councilor,
under-treasurer, or chancellor of the exchequer—all
these offices were filled. In 1521 More
was knighted, in 1523 he was speaker of the House
of Commons, and in 1525 chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster.</p>

<p>Erasmus writes to Ulrich von Hutten in 1519 in
praise of More’s public work: “In serious matters
no man’s advice is more prized, and when the king
wishes for recreation no man’s conversation is more
entertaining. Often there are matters deep and involved
that demand a grave and prudent judge,
and More unravels these questions in a way that
gives satisfaction to both sides. Yet no one has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
ever prevailed on him to receive a gift for his decision.
Happy that commonwealth where kings
appoint such officials! No pride has come to him
with his high estate. With all the weight of state
affairs he remembers his old friends, and returns
from time to time to the books he loves so well.
Whatever influence has come to him with his high
office, whatever favour he enjoys with his wealthy
king, he uses all for the good of the state and for
the assistance of his friends. Ever fond of conferring
benefits and wonderfully prone to pity, his disposition
has grown with his power of indulging it. Some
he helps with money, to others he gives protection,
and others he recommends for promotion. When
he can help in no other way he does it by his advice:
no one is sent away dejected. You might well say
that he had been appointed the public guardian of
the distressed and needy.”</p>

<p>If the cares of state did not cut off Sir Thomas
More from assisting old acquaintances, they made
great inroads into the home life he loved so well.
He had married again on the death of his first wife,
and his letters to his children, especially to his “most
dear daughter, Margaret”—Roper’s wife—are full
of tenderness. He is anxious about the education of
his children, and rejoices that his daughter shares
his love for books. We find him writing to Margaret
Roper just after her marriage in <span class="locked">1522:—</span></p>

<p>“I am therefore delighted to read that you have
made up your mind to give yourself diligently to
philosophy, and to make up by your earnestness in
future for what you have lost in the past by neglect.
My darling Margaret, I indeed have never found
you idling, and your unusual learning in almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
every kind of literature shows that you have been
making active progress. So I take your words as
an example of the great modesty that makes you
prefer to accuse yourself falsely of sloth rather than
to boast of your diligence, unless your meaning is
that you will give yourself so earnestly to study that
your past history will seem like indolence by comparison....
Though I earnestly hope that you will
devote the rest of your life to medical science and
sacred literature, so that you may be well furnished
for the whole scope of human life, which is to have
a healthy soul in a healthy body, and I know that
you have already laid the foundations of these studies,
and there will be always opportunity to continue the
building; yet I am of opinion that you may with
great advantage give some years of your yet flourishing
youth to humane letters and liberal studies....
It would be a delight, my dear Margaret, to me to
converse long with you on these matters, but I have
just been interrupted and called away by the servants,
who have brought in supper. I must have
regard to others, else to sup is not so sweet as to talk
with you.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>The close friend of Erasmus and Dean Colet, an
accepted champion of the New Learning, More
was naturally enthusiastic for education—for girls as
for boys. He had written to Gunnell, for a time the
tutor of his <span class="locked">family:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>“Though I prefer learning, joined with virtue, to
all the treasures of kings, yet renown for learning,
when it is not united with a good life, is nothing else
than splendid and notorious infamy: this would be
especially the case in a woman.... Since erudition
in woman is a new thing and a reproach to the sloth
of men, many will gladly assail it and impute to
literature what is really the fault of nature, thinking
from the vices of the learned to get their own
ignorance esteemed as virtue. On the other hand
if a woman (and this I desire and hope with you as
the teacher for all my daughters) to eminent virtue
should add an outwork of even moderate skill in
literature, I think she will have more real profit than
if she had obtained the riches of Crœsus and the
beauty of Helen.”</p>

<p>In this letter More goes on to speak of the profit
of learning and the happiness of those who give
themselves to it—“possessing solid joy they will
neither be puffed up by the empty praises of men nor
dejected by evil tongues.”</p>

<p>“These I consider the genuine fruits of learning,
and though I admit that all literary men do not
possess them, I would maintain that those who give
themselves to study with such views (avoiding the
precipices of pride and haughtiness, walking in the
pleasant meadows of modesty, not dazzled at the
sight of gold) will easily attain their end and become
perfect. Nor do I think that the harvest will be
much affected whether it is a man or a woman who
sows the field. They both have the same human
nature, which reason differentiates from those of
beasts; both therefore are equally suited for those
studies for which reason is perfectioned, and becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
fruitful like a ploughed land on which the seed of
good lessons has been sown.”</p>

<p>This strong love for wise learning, laying emphasis
on a complete education—the training in virtue no
less than the knowledge of letters—had its roots in
More’s character. The “genuine fruits of learning”
ripen in his life and death. His wide toleration,
which will blame no man for not taking the path he
trod to martyrdom, is coupled inextricably with a
refinement of conscience that cannot be sullied by a
denial of his faith. The freedom of conscience
Thomas More claimed for himself he most willingly
allows to others. Just as the education he valued for
himself he extends to all his children.</p>

<p>Standing largely aloof from the violent controversies
Luther had started, hating the bitter
intolerance and savage abuse of theological strife,
refusing to be drawn into the deadly discussion of
Henry VIII.’s divorce, Sir Thomas More is content
to live in loyal devotion to his religion and to the
service of the state, if haply he may. And when this
is denied him he is content to die, retaining his
tolerant good-humour and the love of his kind to
the end, and without resentment at his fate.</p>

<p>The courage of the sage never failed Sir Thomas
More in his public work. As “a beardless boy” he
had resisted in parliament the king’s extortions, as
speaker of the House of Commons he protected the
privileges of the commons. Wolsey had come down
to the House with all his train to command a subsidy,
but no word was uttered in reply to his address. In
vain Wolsey appealed for an answer, Sir Thomas
More could only declare that the speaker, then the
mouthpiece of the commons, had nothing to say till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
he had heard the opinion of the House. “Whereupon,
the cardinal, displeased with Sir Thomas
More that had not in this parliament in all things
satisfied his desire, suddenly arose and departed.”</p>

<p>High as More stood at that time in the affection
of Henry, Sir Thomas knew the king, and the
nature of the favour of princes. Roper relates that
when he offered his congratulations, at the time of
the appointment to the chancellorship of the Duchy
of Lancaster, More answered, “I may tell thee I
have no cause to be proud thereof, for if my head
would win him a castle in France (for then was there
war betwixt us) it should not fail to go.”</p>

<p>Aware of Henry’s character, More yet had no
choice but to accept the lord chancellorship from the
king on Wolsey’s fall in 1529. It was no matter
for personal satisfaction, and More’s reply to the
Duke of Norfolk was substantially the same as his
previous answer to Roper: “Considering how wise
and honourable a prelate had lately before taken so
great a fall, he had no cause to rejoice in his new
dignity.” Erasmus wrote, “I do not at all congratulate
More, nor literature; but I do indeed
congratulate England, for a better or holier judge
could not have been appointed.”</p>

<p>On November 3rd, 1529, Sir Thomas More, as
chancellor, opened parliament, and in a long speech
declared that “the cause of its assembly was to
reform such things as had been used or permitted by
inadvertence, or by changes of time had become
inexpedient.” It was the opening of the seven years’
parliament, and before six years should run, this
same parliament would, at the king’s order, condemn
Sir Thomas More by act of attainder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>The position of the new chancellor was dangerous
from the first. Wolsey had fallen because he had
failed to help Henry to a divorce from his queen,
Catherine of Aragon, and More had been made his
successor because the king had counted on him to
accomplish the “great matter.” All that Sir
Thomas could hope for was that he might be
allowed to do his work as chancellor without being
mixed up with divorce proceedings. As long as he
was not called upon to declare publicly that the
divorce was right, he had no wish to interfere in the
matter. First to last no word of approval came
from More’s lips to encourage Henry in the divorce,
but he was not the man to express judgment on a
case that he did not wish brought before him.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> In
the end the chancellor’s very silence turned Henry’s
disappointment to active displeasure, and More’s life
was taken in savage revenge for non-compliance
with the royal will.</p>

<p>Henry’s divorce dates the beginning of the Protestant
Reformation in England—of that ecclesiastical
revolution in which the supremacy of Rome
was rejected, the crown superseded the pope as
supreme head of the Church of England, and
England was detached from the rest of Roman
Catholic Christendom. In the reigns of Edward VI.
and Elizabeth the revolution proceeded still further,
and Catholic rites and doctrines, service books and
ceremonies were rigorously cast out of the Church
of England, and all who adhered to the old order in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
religion were punished by law. But those days were
far off as yet.</p>

<p>More, at the outset of this revolution, declines to
follow the king in the rejection of the old allegiance
to Rome. All he asks for is freedom of conscience
to remain in the faith of his fathers, to worship as
Christians in England had worshipped since the
coming of Augustine. To escape death by giving
up this freedom is impossible for Sir Thomas More.</p>

<p>The divorce from Queen Catherine is the turning
point in More’s worldly fortunes as well as in ecclesiastical
affairs in England.</p>

<p>Eighteen years passed from the day of Henry’s
marriage to Catherine, on his accession to the
throne, before the divorce was mooted. The
scruple was that Catherine had been formerly
betrothed to his dead brother Arthur; the moving
force of Henry’s petition for divorce was the desire
to marry Anne Boleyn. Unable to get the marriage
annulled at Rome, or to get a favourable opinion
from the universities, Henry fell back on Archbishop
Cranmer to decree the divorce, and finally this was
done in 1533, all appeals to Rome being henceforth
forbidden. Henry had already, in 1531, called upon
the clergy to acknowledge him as the supreme head
of the Church of England, and the following year
they were required to surrender the ancient right to
meet and enact canons.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>In these four years the chancellor had kept out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
political life as far as he could, and had given his
attention to his judicial work. But in May, 1532,
he resigned the great seal into the king’s hands,
“seeing that affairs were going badly, and likely to
be worse, and that if he retained his office he would
be obliged to act against his conscience, or incur the
king’s displeasure as he had already begun to do, for
refusing to take his part against the clergy. His
excuse was that his salary was too small, and that he
was not equal to the work. Everyone is concerned,
for there never was a better man in the office.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>Nothing is known of Sir Thomas More’s work in
the chancery except his integrity and his despatch.
“When More took the office there were causes that
had remained undecided for twenty years. He presided
so dexterously and successfully that once after
taking his seat and deciding a case, when the next
case was called, it was found that there was no second
case for trial. Such a thing is said never to have
happened before or since.” (Stapleton.)</p>

<p>For nearly two years More lived unmolested after
his resignation of the chancellorship; but he had
incurred the enmity of the king and the hatred of
Anne Boleyn, and Henry was swiftly driving at
certain changes in religion that were to bring Sir
Thomas More to the Tower and the block, and
many another honest Christian to the prison and the
gallows of Tyburn.</p>

<p>In June, 1533, after Cranmer had duly pronounced
Henry’s marriage with Catherine void, came the
coronation of Anne Boleyn, and Sir Thomas More
declined an invitation from some of the bishops to
be present at the celebration. He knew that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
absence would be marked unfavourably by the king,
and was ready to pay the penalty; but his care in
avoiding the expression of any disapproval of
Henry’s proceedings required an equal care that no
approval should be expressed. To have been present
at the coronation of Anne would have been, for
More, to condone the divorce.</p>

<p>In the autumn came an attempt to include More,
with Bishop Fisher and certain monks and friars, in
the treason of the “Holy Maid of Kent,”—Elizabeth
Barton, a Canterbury nun. The
“treason” amounted to this, that the nun, who was
given to prophesying, declared that God had revealed
to her to speak against Henry’s divorce, and
it was sufficient to bring her to Tyburn. But against
Sir Thomas More no shred of evidence could be
procured, for none existed. He had seen the nun,
and talked with her, and “held her in great estimation,”
but would neither commit himself to a belief
in her visions, nor permit any discussion on the
king’s doings; but wrote to the nun a letter which
could not have been more prudent, as he exhorted
her “to attend to devotion, and not meddle in the
affairs of princes.”</p>

<p>The name of Sir Thomas More was struck out of
the bill of attainder, but the days of his liberty were
already numbered.</p>

<p>The Act of Succession, passed in March, 1534,
made Mary, the daughter of Henry and Catherine,
illegitimate, and Elizabeth, Anne’s child, the heir to
the throne. The act also declared that “all the
nobles of the realm, spiritual and temporal, and all
other subjects arrived at full age, should be obliged
to take corporal oath, in the presence of the king or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
his commissioners, to observe and maintain the whole
effect and contents of the act,” under the penalties
for treason for refusal. The words of the oath were
not inserted in the act, and the commissioners drew
up a formula, requiring all persons to affirm in
addition that the marriage with Catherine was invalid,
and the marriage with Anne valid, and further
to recall and repudiate allegiance to any foreign
authority, prince, or potentate. This was a much
larger demand than parliament had authorised, for it
contained a denial of the papal supremacy, while all
that the act had required was an acknowledgment of
the succession to the crown. The pope had only just
given his final decision on Henry’s appeal for divorce
(March, 1534), and the decision had been against the
king and in favour of the marriage. The oath
now administered was in direct opposition to the
supremacy of Rome, and as such was impossible to
the consciences of men like Sir Thomas More and
Bishop Fisher, though the great bulk of the clergy
took it without giving any trouble.</p>

<p>More was quite prepared to swear to the succession
of Elizabeth. Parliament had, in his eyes, a
plain right to decide who should wear the crown,
and the doctrine of divine hereditary kingship does
not come in till the Stuarts. But this mere willingness
to comply with the letter of the law was not
sufficient. More’s silent want of sympathy with the
divorce, and with the breach it involved with Rome,
was intolerable to Henry, who had counted More
amongst his dearest friends; for friend or foe, in
Henry’s power, could only live by abject agreement
with the royal pleasure. No king had three more
faithful servants than Henry VIII. had in Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Wolsey, Thomas More, and Thomas Cromwell, and
no king destroyed his ministers with such fierce
caprice.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, unable to take the oath, was
sent to the Tower in April, 1534, Bishop Fisher
having already been lodged there. In November
parliament met again, and passed the Act of
Supremacy, making Henry VIII. “the supreme head
of the Church of England,” and declaring that on
and after the first of February, 1535, it was high
treason “to deprive the king’s most royal person, the
queen’s, or their heirs apparent of their dignity, title
or name of their royal estates, or slanderously and
maliciously publish or pronounce, by express writing
or words, that the king, our sovereign lord, should be
heretic, schismatic, tyrant, infidel, etc.” Under this
act Sir Thomas More was to be assailed and to die.
That the martyrdom was a “judicial murder” is
plain—to Lord Campbell it was “the blackest crime
that ever has been perpetrated in England under the
form of law.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>The indictment was for treason, and on July 1st, a
week after Bishop Fisher’s execution, Sir Thomas
More was brought before the judges. To the charge
of having refused the king, “maliciously, falsely, and
traitorously, his title of supreme head of the Church
of England,” More answered that the statute had
been passed while he was in prison, and that he was
dead to the world, and had not cared about such
things—“your statute cannot condemn me to death
for such silence, for neither your statute nor any laws
in the world punish people except for words and
deeds—surely not for keeping silence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>“To this the king’s proctor replied that such
silence was a certain proof of malice intended
against the statute, especially as every faithful
subject, on being questioned about the statute, was
obliged to answer categorically that the statute was
good and wholesome.” “Surely,” replied More, “if
common law is true, and he who is silent seems to
consent, my silence should rather be taken as
approval than contempt of your statute.”</p>

<p>To the first article charging him with having
always maliciously opposed the king’s second
marriage, More had answered that anything he had
said had been according to his conscience, and that
for “this error,” he had already suffered fifteen
months’ imprisonment, and the confiscation of his
property.</p>

<p>The trial was soon over, for the king had decided
on More’s death when Fisher was executed, ordering
the preachers to set forth to the people the
treasons of the late Bishop of Rochester and of Sir
Thomas More; “joining them together though the
later was still untried.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> The jury, after a quarter of
an hour’s absence, declared him guilty of death for
maliciously contravening the statute, and sentence
was pronounced by the chancellor “according to the
tenour of the new law.”</p>

<p>Death being now in sight, and faith having been
kept with his conscience, More has no longer any
reason to observe silence. To the usual question
whether he has anything to say against the
sentence, he replied, that for the seven years he had
studied the matter he could not find that supremacy
in a church belonged to a layman, or to any but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
see of Rome, as granted personally by our Lord
when on earth to St. Peter and his successors; and
that, as the city of London could not make a law
against the laws of the realm of England, so
England could not make a law contrary to the
general law of Christ’s Catholic Church; and that
the Magna Charta of England said that “the
English Church should be free to enjoy all its rights,”
as the king had sworn at his consecration. Interrupted
by the chancellor with the inquiry whether
he wished to be considered wiser and better than all
the bishops and nobles of the realm who had sworn
to the king’s supremacy, More retorted, “For one
bishop of your opinion, my lord, I have a hundred
saints of mine; and for one parliament of yours, and
God knows of what kind, I have all the general
councils for a thousand years.” The Duke of Norfolk
said that now his malice was clear.</p>

<p>On the sixth of July, 1535, Sir Thomas More
was beheaded on Tower Hill, for the king remitted
the ferocious mutilations that accompanied the executions
for treason at Tyburn. “The scaffold was
very unsteady, and putting his feet on the ladder, he
said, merrily, to the lieutenant of the Tower: “I
pray thee see me safe up, and for my coming down
let me shift for myself.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>Then, with a simple request to the people standing
round to pray for him, and to bear witness that he
died a Catholic for the faith of the Catholic Church,
a friendly word to the executioner, and a last prayer—the
51st Psalm—the axe fell, and More was dead.</p>

<p>Beyond More’s scholarship and wit, and his affection
for his family and friends, stands out his great,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
unflinching quality of loyalty to conscience. When the
power was in his hands as lord chancellor, no one
was put to death by Sir Thomas More for heresy in
England, though he did what he could by his pen to
check the innovations of Luther, which he hated,—not
only because they broke up the unity of Christendom,
but because, it seemed to him, they struck at
all social morality and decency.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> The violence
of Luther’s outbreak, the determination of the
Lutherans—sure of their own possession of the
truth—to allow no liberty to Catholics, and the antinomian
communism of the anabaptists—all these
things made Protestantism detestable to men like Sir
Thomas More and Erasmus, and made More declare
that dogmatising heretics ought to be repressed by
the state as breeders of strife and contention. But
his own record is clear: “And of all that ever came
in my hand for heresy, as help me God, saving (as I
said) the sure keeping of them, had never any of
them any stripe or stroke given them, so much as a
fillip on the forehead.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>“What other controversialist can be named, who,
having the power to crush antagonists whom he
viewed as the disturbers of the quiet of his own
declining years, the destroyers of all the hopes which
he had cherished for mankind, contented himself
with severity of language?”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>The author of the <cite>Utopia</cite> was a critic, as
Colet and Erasmus were, of abuses in the Church;
but like his friends he lived and died a Catholic.
He saw Lutheranism as the source of a thousand
ills, and with Erasmus opposed it; but though
heretics were anti-social and factious, he would
not put one to death for error.</p>

<p>It is all through Sir Thomas More’s character—this
respect for conscience. There is no going back
on the wide toleration of his early manhood, and
high office and responsibilities of state no more
cramp or belittle his faith than they destroy his playfulness
or the warmth of his affections.</p>

<p>He died a martyr for the religion of his life,
for the simple right to abide in the old Catholic
paths of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>As Sir Thomas More was not the first of the
Catholic martyrs at the Reformation, for he had
seen his old friends, the Carthusian monks, carried to
Tyburn, so he was not the last. For the next fifty
years of Henry and Elizabeth, English men and
women were to suffer for the old faith of England,
and in Mary’s reign to die as bravely for Protestantism.</p>

<p>In spite of monasteries and priories destroyed, and
parish churches stripped and plundered, in spite of
penal laws which banned its priesthood and proscribed
its worship, the Catholicism More died for
has endured in England. All that parliament could
do to exterminate the belief in papal supremacy has
been done; all that panic and prejudice could
accomplish by “popish plots” to the same end has
been accomplished. These things have been no
more successful than the mad “no popery” riots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Lord George Gordon in crushing the faith of the
Roman Catholic minority. The penal laws have
gone, Catholic emancipation has been obtained, a
Catholic hierarchy has been set up, and to-day in
England the freedom of conscience that was refused
to Sir Thomas More is the accepted liberty of all.</p>

<p>In 1887 Sir Thomas More, with Bishop Fisher
and the Carthusian martyrs, were beatified by Pope
Leo XIII. Serving their religion in life and death,
they served the cause of human liberty, withstanding
Henry as Anselm withstood the Red King, and
as Langton withstood John.</p>

<h3 class="left">ROBERT KET AND THE<br />
NORFOLK RISING.
<span class="subhead">1549.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> Norfolk Rising of the sixteenth century
was a land war, caused directly by
the enclosing of the common fields of the
peasants, and the break up of the
accustomed rural life.</p>

<p>The landowners finding greater profit in breeding
sheep and cattle than in the small holdings of
peasants, began, about 1470, to seize the fields which
from time immemorial had been cultivated by the
country people in common, and to evict whole
parishes by pulling down all the dwelling places.
For eighty years these clearances were going on.
Acts of Parliament were passed in 1489 and 1515
to prohibit the “pulling down of towns” and to
order the rebuilding of such towns, and the restoration
of pasture lands to tillage, but both acts were quite
inoperative. In 1517, Cardinal Wolsey’s Royal
Commission on Enclosures reported on the defiance
of the law in seven Midland counties, where more
than 36,000 acres had been enclosed; but legal
proceedings against the landowners were stayed on
the latter promising to make restitution.</p>

<p>Thomas More, in the first part of his <cite>Utopia</cite>,
in 1516, described for all time what the enclosures
he witnessed meant for England.</p>

<p>“For look in what parts of the realm doth grow
the finest and therefore dearest wool, there noblemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
and gentlemen, yea, and certain abbots, holy men
no doubt, not contenting themselves with the yearly
revenues and profits that were wont to grow to their
forefathers and predecessors of their lands, nor being
content that they live in rest and pleasure—nothing
profiting, yea, much annoying the public weal—leave
no ground for tillage, they inclose all into
pastures; they throw down houses; they pluck down
towns and leave nothing standing but only the
church to be made a sheep fold.... They turn
all dwelling-places and all glebe land into desolation
and wilderness. Therefore, that one covetous and
insatiable comorant may compass about and inclose
many thousand acres of ground together within one
pale or hedge, the husbandmen be thrust out of their
own, or else either by cunning and fraud, or by
violent oppression, or by wrongs and injuries they
be so wearied, that they be compelled to sell all. By
one means therefore or another, either by hook or
by crook they must needs depart away, men, women,
husbands, wives, fatherless children, widows, mothers
with their young babies, and their whole household
small in substance and large in number, as husbandry
requireth many hands. Away they trudge, I say,
out of their known and accustomed houses, finding
no place to rest in.... And when they have
wandered abroad till the little they have be spent,
what can they then else do but steal, and then justly
be hanged, or else go about a begging. And yet
then also they be cast in prison as vagabonds,
because they go about and work not: whom no man
will set a work, though they never so willingly proffer
themselves thereto. For one shepherd or herdsman
is enough to eat up that ground with cattle, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
occupying whereof about husbandry many hands
were requisite.”</p>

<p>This was social England in the early years of
Henry VIII., and every year saw things grow worse
for the rural folk, in spite of further royal proclamations
against enclosures in 1526. A series of
bad harvests drove a starving population to riot in
Norfolk in 1527 and 1529. In 1536 came the
suppression of 376 lesser monasteries, followed two
years later by the dissolution of all remaining
monasteries and priories, and in 1547 by the royal
confiscation of the property of the religious guilds and
brotherhoods.</p>

<p>The landowners having established a starving
unemployed class by the simple process of depriving
people of access to the land, and the crown having
removed the only source of relief to the unemployed
by destroying the monasteries, it remained for
parliament to deal with the “social problem” thus
created by declaring poverty a crime, and the
unemployed person a felon. The lash and the
gallows were to solve the problem.</p>

<p>In 1531, an act of parliament granted licences to
the impotent beggar, and ordered a whipping for all
other mendicants. Five years later stronger
measures were adopted, and whipping was only
permitted to first offenders: mutilation and hanging
were the subsequent penalties on conviction, and
thousands of unemployed men and women suffered
under this act. But still the unemployed existed,
for the enclosures had not been stopped; and so the
first year of Edward VI. saw an act passed declaring
the convicted unemployed “a slave.” (As it seemed
to many that parliament had got rid of papal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
authority only to bring back slavery in England, this
act was repealed in two years, and the act of 1531
revived.)</p>

<p>The bitterness of the agrarian misery, the violent
destruction of all the old religious customs and
habits of the people, the confiscation of the funds
of the guilds, the open despoiling of the parish
churches of the people<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>—all these things plunged
the country into confusion and despair. The
general rising in Lincolnshire and the north in 1536
(known as the “Pilgrimage of Grace”) against the
suppressions of the monasteries, and the rising in
Cornwall and Devon in 1549 against Edward’s VI.’s
new Book of Common Prayer were strong manifestations
of the popular dislike of the changes
made in religion by Henry VIII. and the ministers
of Edward VI.</p>

<p>In Norfolk, in 1537, the people made an insurrection
against the suppression of the monasteries; but
the later risings of 1540 (at Griston, when one John
Walker “exhorted the people to destroy the gentry”),
and in 1549, under Ket, were not concerned with
the religious troubles of the times, but were frankly
agrarian. The Norfolk rising, which Ket led, was
no more connected with Protestantism than the
Peasant Revolt of 1381 was with Lollardy. Agrarian
disturbances took place in a number of counties in
1549. In May the peasants of Somerset and
Lincoln were in revolt, and in July there were
tumults in Essex, Kent, Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire,
and Oxfordshire. A rude Cambridge ballad of the
time extols the pulling down of enclosures:</p>

</div>

<p>In 1548 Protector Somerset had followed Wolsey’s
footsteps in issuing a proclamation for a royal commission
to inquire and report concerning enclosures,
and to give the names of all who kept more than
two thousand sheep or who had “taken from
any other their commons.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> The commissioners
were also “to reform” any cases of the enclosing of
commons and highways, “without due recompense,”
which they might find; “and to the intent your
doings may proceed without all suspicion, and the
people conceive some good hope of reformation at
your hands, we would that as many of you as be
in any of the cases to be reformed, do first, for
example’s sake, begin to the reformation of yourselves.”</p>

<p>Somerset’s ingenuous suggestion was naturally
disregarded by the commissioners, and beyond
making inquiries and publishing a report—to the
effect that in the counties of Suffolk, Essex, Hertford,
Kent, and Worcester nearly all the common
lands<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> had been enclosed, while in Norfolk and
Northampton large enclosures had been made—the
commission of 1548 was as fruitless as its predecessors.
Somerset, however, got some reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
by it as an enemy to the enclosures, and certainly
incurred the dislike of the landowners. But where
Wolsey, in the hey-day of power, had failed, there
was small chance of success for Somerset, with the
country in a state of anarchy, and the nation rent
and distracted by a violent revolution in the Church.</p>

<p>The only strong movement to prevent the utter
downfall of the country-people was the Norfolk
Rising, which Robert Ket directed in the summer of
1549. It failed in the end, but for more than six
weeks the power of the landlords was broken round
Norwich, their enclosures were stopped, and the
hope of better things filled the hearts of the peasants.</p>

<p>The rising began at Attleborough on 20th June
when Squire Green, of Wylby, set up fences and
hedges round the common lands at Harpham and
Attleborough, and the people, excited by news that
in Kent similar fences had been destroyed, proceeded
to pull them down. For the next fortnight
the revolt had neither leaders nor organization.
“There were secret meetings of men running hither
and thither, and then withdrawing themselves for
secret conferences, but at length they all began to
deal tumultuously and to rage openly.” On July 7th
the annual feast at Wymondham, in honour of the
translation of St. Thomas of Canterbury, brought
the country folk together from miles round; and at
the close of the fair they all set off to break down
the fences set up round the common lands at Hetherset
by one Sergeant Flowerdew.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>Flowerdew, unable to save his fences, proposed a
diversion. The Kets at Wymondham had made
enclosures, why shouldn’t the rioters deal with them
in similar fashion? Flowerdew actually paid over
40d. to encourage an attack on the Kets.</p>

<p>Robert Ket and his brother were well-known men.
Both were craftsmen, Robert, a tanner, and William,
a butcher. They were landowners besides, and men
of substance and of old family, for it was said the
Kets had been in the land since the Norman Conquest.
Robert Ket held three manors from the
Earl of Warwick; his yearly income was put down
at £50, and his property valued at 1,000 marks.
Like other landowners, the Kets had made enclosures,
but on the arrival of the people from Hetherset
they at once declared themselves willing to
stand by the movement for freeing the land. Robert
Ket felt the misery of his neighbours. He saw that if
the revolt was to be anything more than a local riot
it must have necessary guidance, and his sympathies
were entirely on the democratic side. And so from
that time forward he gave up the quiet of a country
gentleman’s life at Wymondham for the strenuous
movement of an insurgent camp.</p>

<p>To the appeal of the people for help, Ket
answered passionately, “I am ready, and will be
ready at all times, to do whatever, not only to
repress, but to subdue the power of great men.
Whatsoever lands I have enclosed shall again be
made common unto ye and all men, and my own
hands shall first perform it.”</p>

<p>Then Robert Ket went on to commit himself
body and soul to the movement, resolved that the
peasants should not be left unaided in the struggle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
they had begun, and willing to take upon himself the
burden and responsibility of leadership.</p>

<p>“You shall have me, if you will, not only as a
companion, but as a captain; and in the doing of
the so great a work before us, not only as a fellow,
but for a leader, author and principal.”</p>

<p>If the ambition which clutches at sovereignty and
rule is despicable, even more despicable is the weakness
which refuses to take command at times of
peril.</p>

<p>To Robert Ket and his brother there was no
promise of the world’s honour and glory should the
rising be successful. At the best would be the
satisfaction of a battle fought and won for the
deliverance of long-suffering peasants. At the worst
the laying down of life in a good cause, as Geoffrey
Litster and many a Norfolk man had done in bygone
days.</p>

<p>Robert Ket’s leadership was acclaimed with enthusiasm,
nor was it ever disputed throughout the
rising. In this, the last of the great popular risings
in England, the Norfolk men were as loyal to their
leader as the men of Kent were to Wat Tyler and
Jack Cade. And in each case that loyalty had ample
justification.</p>

<p>There were but a thousand men involved when
the rising began, but under Ket’s command the
movement passed rapidly from the fluid “running
hither and thither” condition of the first fortnight,
and became the march of an organized army.</p>

<p>On July 10th, two days after Ket took command,
this army was on the road to Norwich, and after
crossing the river at Cringleford, lay encamped at
Eaton Wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>It is plain from Ket’s speeches to his men, and
from “The Rebels’ Complaint,” which he published at
this time, that to Robert Ket the rising was not only
to put down enclosures, its aim was rather to strike at
the root of the evil and to put an end to the ascendancy
of the landlord class, and make England a free
commonwealth. Either the people must put down
landlords, or very soon the landlords would have the
whole land in their possession, and the people would
be in hopeless and helpless subjection. Had not
an act of parliament been actually passed making
“slaves” of the landless men, dispossessed by
enclosures? When parliament was establishing
slavery it was time for honest men to be up and
doing, rousing the people to action.</p>

<p>Ket’s speech at Eaton Wood is a fierce attack on
the landlords, and a reminder that having ventured
so far, the peasants must advance yet further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now are ye overtopped and trodden down by gentlemen,
and put out of possibility ever to recover foot. Rivers of
riches ran into the coffers of your landlords, while you are
pair’d to the quick, and fed upon pease and oats like beasts.
You are fleeced by these landlords for their private benefit,
and as well kept under by the public burdens of State wherein
while the richer sort favour themselves, ye are gnawn to the
very bones. Your tyrannous masters often implead, arrest,
and cast you into prison, so that they may the more terrify and
torture you in your minds, and wind your necks more surely
under their arms. And then they palliate these pilleries with
the fair pretence of law and authority! Fine workmen, I
warrant you, are this law and authority, who can do their
dealings so closely that men can only discover them for your
undoing. Harmless counsels are fit for tame fools; for you
who have already stirred there is no hope but in adventuring
boldly.</p></div>

<p>In “The Rebels’ Complaint,” the same note is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
struck. Only by taking up arms, and mixing
Heaven and earth together, can the intolerable
oppression of the landlords be ended.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pride of great men is now intolerable, but our condition
miserable.</p>

<p>These abound in delights; and compassed with the fullness
of all things, and consumed with vain pleasures, thirst only
after gain, inflamed with the burning delights of their desires.</p>

<p>But ourselves, almost killed with labour and watching, do
nothing all our life long but sweat, mourn, hunger, and thirst.
Which things, though they seem miserable and base (as they
are indeed most miserable), yet might be borne howsoever,
if they which are drowned in the boiling seas of evil delights
did not pursue the calamities and miseries of other men with
too much insolent hatred. But now both we and our miserable
condition is a laughing stock to these most proud and
insolent men—who are consumed with ease and idleness.
Which thing (as it may) grieveth us so sore and inflicteth such
a stain of evil report, so that nothing is more grievous for us
to remember, nor more unjust to suffer.</p>

<p>The present condition of possessing land seemeth miserable
and slavish—holding it all at the pleasure of great men; not
freely, but by prescription, and, as it were, at the will and
pleasure of the lord. For as soon as any man offend any of
these gorgeous gentlemen, he is put out, deprived, and thrust
from all his goods.</p>

<p>How long shall we suffer so great oppression to go unrevenged?</p>

<p>For so far as they, the gentlemen, now gone in cruelty and
covetousness, that they are not content only to take all by
violence away from us, and to consume in riot and effeminate
delights what they get by force and villainy, but they must
also suck in a manner our blood and marrow out of our veins
and bones.</p>

<p>The common pastures left by our predecessors for our relief
and our children are taken away.</p>

<p>The lands which in the memory of our fathers were
common, those are ditched and hedged in and made several;
the pastures are enclosed, and we shut out. Whatsoever
fowls of the air or fishes of the water, and increase of the
earth—all these do they devour, consume, and swallow up;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
yea, nature doth not suffice to satisfy their lusts, but they
seek out new devices, and, as it were, forms of pleasures to
embalm and perfume themselves, to abound in pleasant
smells, to pour in sweet things to sweet things. Finally,
they seek from all places all things for their desire and the
provocation of lust. While we in the meantime eat herbs
and roots, and languish with continual labour, and yet are
envied that we live, breathe, and enjoy common air!</p>

<p>Shall they, as they have brought hedges about common
pastures, enclose with their intolerable lusts also all the commodities
and pleasures of this life, which Nature, the parent
of us all, would have common, and bringeth forth every day,
for us, as well as for them?</p>

<p>We can no longer bear so much, so great, and so cruel
injury; neither can we with quiet minds behold so great
covetousness, excess, and pride of the nobility. We will
rather take arms, and mix Heaven and earth together, than
endure so great cruelty.</p>

<p>Nature hath provided for us, as well as for them; hath
given us a body and a soul, and hath not envied us other
things. While we have the same form, and the same condition
of birth together with them, why should they have a
life so unlike unto ours, and differ so far from us in calling?</p>

<p>We see that things have now come to extremities, and we
will prove the extremity. We will rend down hedges, fill up
ditches, and make a way for every man into the common
pasture. Finally, we will lay all even with the ground, which
they, no less wickedly than cruelly and covetously, have
enclosed. Neither will we suffer ourselves any more to be
pressed with such burdens against our wills, nor endure so
great shame, since living out our days under such inconveniences
we should leave the commonwealth unto our
posterity—mourning, and miserable, and much worse than
we received it of our fathers.</p>

<p>Wherefore we will try all means; neither will we ever rest
until we have brought things to our own liking.</p>

<p>We desire liberty and an indifferent (or equal) use of all
things. This will we have. Otherwise these tumults and
our lives shall only be ended together.</p></div>

<p>Revolutionary as this manifesto is, Robert Ket is
seen all through the rising exerting his authority on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
behalf of law and good order, curbing anarchy and
checking ferocity in the rebel camp.</p>

<p>Only one day was spent at Eaton Wood. Ket’s
plan was to advance to Mousehold, a wide stretch of
high, well-wooded ground to the east of Norwich.
Here the camp was fixed on July 12th, the river
having been crossed at Hailsdon, and a night’s halt
called at Drayton—for the mayor of Norwich,
Thomas Cod, positively refused to allow the rebels
to pass through the city. Ket, anxious to unite
citizens and peasants in a common cause, willingly
avoided altercation, and Cod, alarmed at the rising,
and unable to dissuade the insurgents from their
enterprise, was careful to refrain from all hostile
demonstrations. Cod’s one purpose was to exclude
Ket’s army from the city, and to accomplish this he
kept on friendly terms with Ket, even while appealing
to the government to send down troops to suppress
the rising. Ket’s purpose was to break down landlord
rule in Norfolk, extend the area of revolt, and to get
the king to attend to the complaints of his subjects.</p>

<p>Ket’s company at Mousehold numbered no more
than 2,600 on July 12th; but the ringing of bells
and the firing of beacons brought in thousands of
homeless men. At the end of a week 20,000 men
were enrolled under the banner of revolt, and now
Ket had all his work to do in maintaining discipline
and in arranging for provisions for the camp.</p>

<p>It is clear Robert Ket was the right man for a
leader.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> The people trusted him and obeyed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
orders. Cod and two other reputable citizens of
Norwich—Aldrich, an alderman, and Watson, a
preacher—attended the camp daily, and along with
Ket and his brother William sat under a great tree,
known as the Oak of Reformation, and administered
justice. The 20,000 hungry, disinherited men
carried out in as orderly way as they could the
instructions they received.</p>

<p>Ket’s first business was to send to the king a
plain statement of “Requests and Demands.” He
knew what was wanted for rural England, and refused
to admit that his purpose was disloyal or that
his conduct was rebellion.</p>

<p>The “Requests” were twenty-nine, and they contained
a full statement of the grievances of the
country folk. The chief requests were for the stoppage
of enclosures, the enactment of fair rents, the
restoration of common fishing rights in sea and
river, the appointment of resident clergymen in
every parish to preach and instruct the children, and
the free election or official appointment of local
“commissioners” for the enforcement of the laws.
One significant prayer was “that all bond men may
be made free, for God made all free with His precious
bloodshedding.”</p>

<p>This document, which was signed by Ket, Cod
and Aldrich,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> was answered by the arrival of a
herald from the king with a promise that parliament
should meet in October to consider their complaints,
and that something should be done to redress their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
grievances, if in the meantime they would quietly
disperse to their homes.</p>

<p>All this was too vague and uncertain for Ket.
Not till some definite step was taken by king or
parliament to end the present distress was he willing
to lay down his arms and bid his followers disperse.
He had put his hand to the plough, and no turning
back was possible while the evils he had risen
against flourished unchecked.</p>

<p>So Ket put his house in order on Mousehold
Heath. The Oak of Reformation was boarded over
“with rafters,” and to this place of summary justice
landowners were brought and tried for making
enclosures. Two men were chosen by the commons
from every hundred to assist in the work of administration,
and all the people were strictly admonished
“to beware of robbing, spoiling and other evil
demeanours.” As the army had to be victualled,
Ket sent out men armed with his official warrant
requiring the country houses to provide cattle and
corn, “so that no violence or injury be done to any
honest or poor man,” and this requisition brought in
guns, gunpowder and money, in addition to “all
kinds of victual.” The smaller farmers sent their contributions
“with much private good will,” while on
the landowners a great fear had fallen, and it seemed
that the day of their might was passed.</p>

<p>A royal messenger bearing commissions of the
peace to various country gentlemen falling into the
hands of Ket, he was at once deprived of these
documents and sent on his way. Ket filled in the
names of men who had joined the rising on these
commissions, and these new magistrates gave assistance
in maintaining order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>Cod and Aldrich were shocked at the arrest of
landowners. “Notwithstanding were divers gentlemen
taken and brought to prison, some in Norwich
Prison, some in Norwich Castle and some in Surrey
Place.”—St. Leonard’s Hill.</p>

<p>In every case the lives of the landowners were
spared. Stern and unmoved by respect of persons
was Robert Ket, but there was no taint of cruelty,
meanness or bloodthirstiness in his rule. It was not
his purpose to raise civil war or leave a festering
sore of hatred by putting his neighbours to death.
To destroy the power of the landlords and ensure
the right of an evicted people to live on the land was
the aim of the Norfolk Rising.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week relations became
strained between Cod and the army on Mousehold.</p>

<p>It was the custom to have prayers every day under
the Oak, and Dr. Conyers, vicar of St. Martin’s,
Norwich, acted as chaplain. “Grave persons and
good divines” would come out from the city and
preach under the Oak, and on one occasion Dr.
Matthew Parker, a Norwich man, who had been
chaplain to Anne Boleyn, and who was to become
Archbishop of Canterbury under Elizabeth, filled
the pulpit. Parker’s sermon, full of rebukes on the
rising and praise of Edward VI., was so obnoxious,
for “he touched them for their living so near that
they went near to touch him for his life,” that
Conyers only prevented a riot by striking up the
“Te Deum” in English, and during the singing
Parker withdrew “to sing his part at home.”</p>

<p>Matthew Parker was a great man in Norwich (his
brother Thomas became mayor), and the incivility
he had received at Mousehold gave great offence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Cod and the aldermen sent off Leonard Sutherton,
a respectable burgess, to report to the king’s council
the doings in Norfolk, and Sutherton brought back
from London a royal herald, who went out to Mousehold
and promised the king’s pardon to all that
would depart quietly to their homes.</p>

<p>The people cheered and shouted “God save the
king’s majesty,” but to Ket this talk of pardon was
altogether beside the mark. With some dignity he
informed the herald that “kings and princes are
wont to pardon wicked persons, not innocent and
just men,” and added, “I trust I have done nothing
but what belongs to the duty of a true subject.”</p>

<p>The herald then called on John Petibone, the
sword-bearer of Norwich, who with other civic
notables was standing by, to arrest Robert Ket.
But the thing was impossible. Ket had 20,000 men
at his back, and the sword-bearer was supported by
half-a-dozen elderly members of the town council.
All that could be done was to escort the herald into
the city, leaving Ket to his own devices.</p>

<p>There was no more peace between the camp at
Mousehold and the city of Norwich after this.
Hitherto Mayor Cod had retained the keys of the
city, and his authority had been respected by Ket.
At the same time Ket’s men had gone freely to and
fro throughout the city without let or hindrance.
Now all was changed. First the landowners were
being arrested and despoiled, then the learned
doctor, Matthew Parker (was he not master of
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge?) had been
interrupted and hooted, and now a king’s herald was
contemned! Cod ordered the city gates to be made
fast, commanded Ket’s prisoners to be released, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
placed the city’s ordnance in the meadows by the
river. This amounted to a declaration of war, and
Ket replied by bringing up his guns.</p>

<p>The night of July 21st was spent “in fearful shot
on both sides,” but little injury was done. For
Ket’s guns brought “more fear than hurt to the
city,” and “the city ordnance did not much annoy
the enemy.”</p>

<p>In the morning Ket sought to renew peace by
asking permission for the transport of victuals through
the city, “as the custom was of late,” and warning
the mayor that refusal would provoke fire and sword.</p>

<p>Cod refused permission, and Ket opened fire on
the city gates. But “for lack of powder and want
of skill in the gunners the ordnance was spent to
small and little purpose.” A desperate encounter
followed, with bows and arrows for the chief weapons
of offence. Boys from Mousehold, “naked and unarmed,
would pluck the arrows from their bodies
and hand them to the rebels to fire at the city.” At
Bishopsgate a number of men swam the river and
forced their way into the city, and on the night of
July 22nd Norwich was in the hands of Robert
Ket.</p>

<p>No reprisals followed. The herald made a last
attempt to induce the insurgents to disperse by promising
pardons, and was greeted derisively. “Depart
with a plague on thee!” they cried. “To the
devil with these idle promises. We shall only be
oppressed afterwards.” Forthwith the herald did
depart, with eight pounds of gold in his pocket from
the mayor.</p>

<p>Ket retired to Mousehold, the passage through
the city having been secured, and Cod accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
him, leaving a deputy, Augustine Steward, who
lived in the big house in Tombland, opposite Erfingham
Gate, to act as mayor.</p>

<p>Judgment went on as before under the Oak of
Reformation, and people clamoured for the landowners
to be hanged. “So hated at this time was
the name of worship or gentleman, that the basest
of the people, burning with more than hostile hatred,
desired to extinguish, and utterly cut off, not only
the gentry themselves, but if it were possible, all
the offspring and hope of them.” (Nevylle.)</p>

<p>But Ket was as strong in his mercy as in his
resistance to the land enclosers. The gentry were
imprisoned, and made to pay tribute: their fences
were pulled down, but their lives were spared, and
no hurt befell them. In the city Steward, no friend
to Ket, was left undisturbed in authority.</p>

<p>At the end of July came William Parr, Marquis
of Northampton, with 1,500 soldiers, mostly Italian
mercenaries, and a number of country squires with
their retainers, to put down the rising. Steward at
once admitted him to the city; but Northampton—Henry
VIII.’s brother-in-law—was neither a soldier
nor statesman, and after two days’ hard fighting he
fled from Norwich, utterly defeated.</p>

<p>Ket’s men were badly armed, but they had
numbers on their side, and they fought for freedom
and for very life. They swam the river, as before,
and forced an entrance. “Half dead, drowned in
their own and other men’s blood, they would not
give over; but till the last gasp, when their hands
could scarce hold their weapons, would strike at
their adversaries.”</p>

<p>Lord Sheffield fell in the fight on August 1st,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
killed by a stalwart rebel—one Fulke, a butcher and
carpenter by trade—and some hundred of Ket’s men
lay dead. The city suffered. Several houses and
city gates were fired, and only a heavy rain prevented
the flames from spreading. (This same rain
drove many of the rebels to take refuge in the
cathedral, much to the annoyance of the dean and
chapter.)</p>

<p>And now for three weeks Ket had to take charge
of Norwich as well as of Mousehold camp, for it was
impossible to trust Steward. Many of the wealthier
townsmen hastened away to Cambridge and London,
leaving their wives and families behind. Trade was
at an end.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The state of the city began to be in most miserable case,
so that all men looked for utter destruction, both of life and
goods. Then the remnant that feared God, seeing the
plague thus of sorrow increasing, fell to prayer and holy life,
and wished but to see the day that after they might talk
thereover, looking never to recover help again, nor to see
their city prosper.</p>

<p>The women resorted twice a day to prayer, and the servants
(except what must needs stay at home) did the same.
When Ket’s ambassadors were sent to any private house they
were fain to bake or brew or do any work for the camp, else
they were carried as traitors to the Oak. As for trading,
there was none in the city, people being forced to hide up
their choicest goods, and happy were they that had the
faithfullest servants.</p>

<p>They that did keep open their shops were robbed and
spoiled, and their goods were measured by the arm’s length
and dispersed among the rebels; their children they set
away for fear of fire. I, the writer (who was then above
twenty-two years of age, and an eye-witness) was present
after prayer during this dolorous state, when people met and
bewailed the miserable state they were in. (Sutherton.)</p></div>

<p>But for all their misery the tradesmen of Norwich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
were in no fear for their lives. The city had done
its best to thwart the rising, but Ket treated it
generously, allowing neither pillage nor bloodshed—though
he did not scruple to take what goods were
necessary for his army.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> It was beyond the power
of man to prevent all thieving during those first
few weeks of August, for the civic magistracy was
gone, and Ket had large responsibilities on his
hands.</p>

<p>The hope that the rising would become general
turned to disappointment in the weeks that passed
after the flight of Northampton. In Suffolk a
number of men rose at Ket’s call, and made an
unsuccessful attempt to take Yarmouth. A small
camp set up at Rising Chase was dispersed, but for
a fortnight the peasants gathered at Watton, and
stopped the passages of the river at Thetford and
Brandon Ferry. For want of leadership they then
came on to Mousehold. At Hingham a rising was
put down by Sir Edmund Knyvett. And while Ket
waited, hoping against hope for better news, the
fugitive citizens from Norwich had already persuaded
Somerset to send down an army to crush
the revolt.</p>

<p>On August 21st the Earl of Warwick, with 14,000
troops, reached Cambridge, and three days later was
at Norwich.</p>

<p>Warwick, Henry VIII.’s high chamberlain, the
son of Dudley, Henry VII.’s minister, was a man of
war and resolution. Sent down to suppress the
rising he did his work, but not till he had tried an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
appeal to the peasants to disperse without further
trouble.</p>

<p>Halting outside the city, Warwick sent a herald
to proclaim pardon to all who should now return to
their homes, and, as before, the people shouted,
“God save King Edward!” Ket himself talked
with the herald on the high ground near Bishop’s
Gate.</p>

<p>Negotiations ended abruptly. Some ill-mannered
boy gave an indecent and offensive salute to the
herald, and was shot dead by an arrow from the
herald’s escort. At once the cry of “treachery”
was raised by the people, and all talk of peace was
at an end. While the herald tried to persuade Ket
to come to the Earl of Warwick under a flag of
truce, the rebels gathered round their leader and
besought him not to forsake them. To Ket there
could be sure reliance on royal promises of pardon,
and no surrender of the charge he had undertaken.
His reply to the herald was to retire on Mousehold
and prepare for battle.</p>

<p>Warwick at once entered the city, and began the
business of pacification by promptly hanging sixty
men in the Market Place, by Norwich Castle,
“without hearing the cause”; and by issuing a proclamation
that all who were out of doors would
receive similar treatment. Then came a mishap, for
the greater part of Warwick’s artillery fell into Ket’s
hands. The drivers of the gun-carriages, entering
the city after the soldiers, by St. Bennet’s Gate on
the west, and ignorant of the way, actually passed
out at Bishop’s Gate on the east on the very road
towards Mousehold, and were quickly taken. Ket
had now the advantage in ordnance, and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
fighting in the city all Sunday, August 25th. So
uncertain was the issue that the burgesses feared
Warwick would suffer Northampton’s fate, and
prayed him to depart without further loss. But
Warwick, waiting for reinforcements, and knowing
that 1,400 German mercenaries were close at hand,
was not the man to beat an ignominious retreat.</p>

<p>The hireling “lanznechts” arrived next day, and
on Tuesday, August 27th, came the fatal battle.</p>

<p>Instead of remaining at Mousehold, where a
strong resistance might have been made, the rebels
decided to march out boldly from their camp and
meet the king’s army in the open country that lay
between Mousehold Heath and the city. An old
song was recalled, which, it seemed, foretold victory
in such a case:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The country gnoffes (churls), Hob, Dick, and Rick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With clubs and clouted shoon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Shall fill the vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Of Dussindale</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With slaughtered bodies soon.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the country churls were to be the slaughtered,
and not the slaughterers.</p>

<p>Warwick marched out by the north-east gate of
St. Martin-at-the-Oak, and for the last time a herald
promised pardon to all who would surrender. But
the hangings in the market place had destroyed all
confidence in such proclamations, and the answer to
the herald was that they “perceived this pardon to
be nothing else but a cask full of ropes and halters.”</p>

<p>Ket’s judgment failed him utterly on that last
day of the rising. On the strength of an irrelevant
old song he allowed his army to go to its doom unchecked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
and at the very time when good generalship
was wanted above all other things, Robert Ket
seems to have lost his nerve, and to have been
struck by some paralysis of the will, as though
conscious of impending ruin.</p>

<p>The peasants poured down into the valley, and
into the meadows beyond Magdalen and Pockthorp
Gates, and fought with desperate courage, but they
were simply cut to pieces by the professional soldiery.
At four o’clock in the afternoon it was all over, the
defeat utter and complete, and Robert Ket and his
brother were in flight.</p>

<p>The remains of the rebel army laid down their
arms, when Warwick himself offered pardon in the
king’s name to those who would surrender.</p>

<p>The rising was at an end. The foreign mercenaries
of the crown had triumphed over English
peasants. Robert Ket was taken the same night at
Swannington, eight miles north of Norwich. He
had ridden away from the battle when the field was
lost, but horse and rider were too tired to proceed
further. Taking refuge in a barn, he was recognized
by some men unloading a wagon of corn and seized.
The farmer’s wife “rated him for his conduct, but he
only prayed her to be quiet, and to give him meat.”
That same night William Ket was taken, and the
two brothers were delivered to the lord lieutenant of
the county, and by him carried to London to be
tried for their lives.</p>

<p>At Mousehold Warwick proved the worth of the
pardons he had given by first having nine of the
bravest of the peasants hanged, drawn, and quartered
under the Oak of Reformation, and distributing
their bodies in the city; and then by hanging 300<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
prisoners on trees, and then forty-nine more at the
Market Cross in Norwich. The country gentlemen
of Norfolk, backed by their wealthier citizens, called
for more executions, till Warwick turned with disgust
from the vindictive clamour of these bloodthirsty
civilians, and pointed out in impatient reproof that
no one would be left “to plough and harrow over
the lands” if all the peasants were massacred.</p>

<p>And now the king’s authority having been re-established,
a public service of thanksgiving was
held in the church of St. Peter, Mancroft, and
August 27th was ordered to be observed henceforth
as “Thanksgiving Day” in Norwich. (This was
done by prayers and sermon until 1667. In the
grammar school, during Elizabeth’s reign, an account
of the rising—<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Furoribus Norfolciensum</cite>,
written in Latin by Nevylle, and violently anti-popular
in expression—was ordered to be used as a
text book in place of the usual classics, and was so
used for some years.)</p>

<p>On September 7th Warwick returned to London.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
In November Robert and William Ket, after lying
in the Tower for two months, were brought to trial.
They offered no defence for what they had done: for
having borne arms without the king’s permission,
and for having striven to stop the robbery and
oppression of the peasant without the authority of
king and parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>On November 26th they were found guilty of high
treason, their property confiscated, and they were
condemned to death. On November 29th they were
delivered out of the custody of the Tower to the
high sheriff of Norfolk, and on December 1st the
Kets were again in Norwich.</p>

<p>It was winter, and hope was dead. The last
great rising of the English peasantry had failed,
crushed without pity, and the leaders of the army of
revolt, who had judged it better to give up ease and
worldly honour rather than acquiesce dumbly in the
enslavement of their poorer neighbours, were to die
as traitors.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> On December 7th the executions were
carried out, and Robert Ket was hanged in chains
outside Norwich Castle, while William Ket was
taken to Wymondham (where he held the manor of
Chossell—Church lands, bought years earlier from
the Earl of Warwick), and there hanged in chains
from the parish church.</p>

<p>The property of the Kets was duly taken by the
servants of the crown, and the bodies of the rebel
leaders swung in the wind—to remind unthinking
men of the reward of rebellion, of the fate of all
who challenge, without success, the arms of government.</p>

<p>The Norfolk Rising was the last great movement
of the English people in social revolt. Riots we
have known even in our times, and mob violence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
but no such rising as those led by Wat Tyler, by
Cade, and by Ket has England seen since the year
1549.</p>

<p>The country people sunk into hopeless poverty
and permanent degradation under Edward VI. and
Elizabeth, and with the rejection by the government
of papal authority, the supremacy of the crown and
of the ministers of the crown was established.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, when the working
people in town and country once more bestirred
themselves at the call of freedom, their wiser leaders
advised political and not revolutionary methods of
action, and the advice has been followed.</p>

<p>But if the year 1549 marks the end of organized
democratic resistance to intolerable misgovernment,
the coming centuries were to see the rise of the
middle class with the insistent demand for the predominance
of that class in the parliament of the
nation, and the incurable belief that in a popularly
elected House of Commons resided all the safeguards
of civil and religious liberty.</p>

<h3 class="left">ELIOT, HAMPDEN, PYM,<br />
AND THE SUPREMACY<br />
OF THE COMMONS.
<span class="subhead">1625–1643</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">John Eliot</span>, John Hampden, John Pym—by
the work of these men comes the supremacy
of the House of Commons in the government
of England.</p>

<p>All three are country gentlemen of good estate, of
high principle and of some learning.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> They are men
of religious convictions, of courage and resolution,
and of blameless personal character. Two of them—Eliot
and Hampden—are content to die for the
cause of good government.</p>

<p>The strong rule of Elizabeth left a difficult legacy
of government to James I. The despotism of the
queen had been forgiven in the success of her State
policy; and if she had no high opinion of parliament,
Elizabeth had ministers who fairly represented the
mind of the English middle class. Elizabeth’s absolutism
in Church and State was the direct following
of Henry VIII., and only at the very close of her
reign was it threatened by the discontent of parliament.
With a shrewd instinct for popularity Elizabeth
at once yielded. Like her father, she saw the
importance of retaining parliament on the side of the
crown and making it the instrument of the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
will. There was no idea in the Tudor mind of
parliament sharing the government with the crown.
The business of the House of Commons of Elizabeth
was to express its opinion and then decree the proposals
of the crown. “Liberty of speech was granted
in respect of the aye or no, but not that everybody
should speak what he listed.” (1592.)</p>

<p>In religion Elizabeth had done her worst to exterminate
the Roman Catholic faith, and by the fierceness
of her persecution had kindled undying enthusiasm
for the old beliefs and worship. But forty
years of repression did their work, and a generation
arose which only knew Catholicism as the faith of a
proscribed and unpatriotic sect, who denied the absolute
sovereignty of the crown and had another
sovereign at Rome—the religion of Spain—popery,
in short: a faith worse than Mahomedanism or
heathenism—the scarlet woman of the Apocalypse—according
to the fierce Puritan expounders of the
Bible, and not to be counted as Christianity. That
this very Roman Catholicism—so hateful because
the penal laws kept it hidden and unknown, and
because it was the religion of Spain, then the national
enemy—had been the religion of all England for
centuries, and that under it the earliest charters of
public liberty had been wrung from the crown, and
the principle of a representative parliament established,
were facts uncontemplated.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth, while persecuting Roman Catholics,
had left in the Book of Common Prayer of the
Church of England a sanction for ceremonial and
for episcopal ordination, and a body of doctrine which
were to be interpreted under the Stuarts by certain
Anglican divines as witnesses to Catholicism. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
interpretation was to be found in Elizabeth’s reign as
a pious opinion. With Laud it was an active principle,
and it brought him to the scaffold. The
Elizabethan bishops in the main were thoroughly
Protestant, the queen was the head of the Church of
England, and the ritual of the Church prescribed by
her was reduced to a simplicity that average Protestants
could accept.</p>

<p>If Elizabeth burnt anabaptists and hanged other
nonconformists, her excuse was that the Church of
England was sufficiently Protestant to include all
well-affected persons. The extreme Puritans whom
she persecuted had this in common with the Roman
Catholics, that neither accepted the absolute supremacy
of the crown, and the best Puritan teaching
in England, even when it counselled conformity to
the Established Church, was creating a mind and
temper that only found expression in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>James I. came to the throne in 1603 prepared to
carry on the Tudor absolutism. He failed because
he had neither Elizabeth’s ministers nor her knowledge
of the English country landowners. James
never realised that Spain was the popular enemy,
that a discontent had suddenly grown up in parliament
in the last years of Elizabeth’s reign, and that
the English landowners—in many cases from their
inherited possession of the old Church lands—were
generally bitterly hostile to the Roman Catholic
religion. James was tolerant in religion, and not
inclined to press Elizabeth’s penal laws against
Roman Catholics, and this very toleration brought him
under the dislike of the country party. He thought
he could disregard the opinion of parliament and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
found that while a House of Commons submitted
to a despotism when the country was governed
by a strong queen, it would not put up with the
follies and extravagance of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p>James died before the strength of the growing
movement for parliamentary government was seen.
Charles who was no more tyrannical than his father,
but even more blind to the signs of the times, fell
before that parliamentary movement—a movement
which outraged all the traditions of Tudor government—and
with his fall brought down the throne, the
House of Lords, and the Established Church. By
his inability to understand the House of Commons,
by his support of the Anglican movement towards
Catholicism in the Church of England, and by the
mistakes of his ministers, Charles ripened the
desire for constitutional monarchy till the desire was
irresistible.</p>

<p>John Eliot gave forcible utterance to this desire,
and died in prison for his speech. John Pym
carried on the work till the sword of civil war was
drawn. John Hampden, “the noblest type of
parliamentary opposition,” was content to back Pym
as he had earlier backed Eliot, and to die on Chalgrove
Field. Brought up to regard as an alien
creed the old belief in papal supremacy in religion,
unable to accept the new doctrine of the Church of
England that the king was supreme by divine right
(a doctrine begotten by the Tudors and dying with
the Stuarts), Eliot, Hampden, and Pym were all of
the same Puritan type which found its authority in
the individual conscience.</p>

<p>Eliot was less afflicted than his colleagues by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
theological Protestantism of the age.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> First and
last he was the straightforward country gentleman,
with exalted views on the sacred responsibility of
civil government, and a high standard of personal
honour. For Eliot there was no nobler sphere of
work for an Englishman than the House of
Commons, and his example has not been without
followers. Seneca and Cicero are on his lips, as the
later Puritans had the Bible on theirs, and his
eloquence marks the beginning of parliamentary
oratory. With a strong and clear view of constitutional
government, Eliot was no republican; he held
to the notion that the king must depend on the
decisions of parliament. Time was to show that
this notion, in the event of a collision between king
and parliament, was to make parliament the predominant
partner.</p>

<p>On his first entry into the House of Commons as
member for St. Germans, in 1614, Eliot was the
friend of Buckingham—whom he had met as a youth
abroad—and on Buckingham’s rise to the lord high
admiralship Eliot was knighted and became vice-admiral
of Devon.</p>

<p>The fidelity of his service to the State as vice-admiral
brought an unpleasant experience of the
will of princes. Grappling with the scourge of
piracy which afflicted the seaports and shipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
trade of the West of England, Eliot accomplished
the arrest of Nutt, a notorious sea-robber. But
Nutt had friends in high places, and Eliot found
himself lodged in the Marshalsea prison over the
business. He was released on Buckingham’s return
from the continent, for the charges were absurd,
and in 1624 returned to the House of Commons as
member for Newport. Two years later Eliot was
estranged from Buckingham—convinced that the
favourite of the king was an evil counsellor—and
had become the recognized leader of the House of
Commons. Once assured in his mind that Buckingham
was responsible for the policy of the king,
Eliot became his implacable opponent. For the
policy of the crown in not making war upon Spain,
in relaxing the penal laws against Roman Catholics,
and for the mismanagement of the war on the continent
in support of the Protestants, Eliot held
Buckingham responsible. In answer to the demand
of Charles for money in 1626, Eliot insisted that an
inquiry into past disasters should precede supply,
and that Buckingham should be impeached. Not
the king but his minister is to blame, Eliot maintained,
for all that was wrong in the State, and this very
speech strikes the note of the campaign that was
beginning. Buckingham was not responsible to
Charles alone, in the eyes of Eliot and his friends,
but also to parliament.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>Charles, quite unable to fathom the depth of the
parliamentary discontent, or to note the strength of
the current against absolutism, fell back upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
old Tudor doctrine of sovereignty, the doctrine of
the high Anglican party in the Church of England,
that the king was responsible for his acts to God
alone. “Parliaments are altogether in my calling,”
he replies to the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Only twenty-five years had passed since Bacon
had declared, “the Queen hath both enlarging and
restraining power: she may set at liberty things
restrained by Statute, and may restrain things which
be at liberty.” Twenty-three years more were
to see monarchy abolished and the king beheaded.
Eliot, standing midway between Bacon and Bradshaw,
cleaves to the theory of constitutional government
and persists in the impeachment of a minister in
whom parliament had no confidence.</p>

<p>The prologue of impeachment declared in the
plainest language the responsibility of the king’s
ministers to parliament, and the responsibility of
parliament to the nation: “The laws of England
have taught us that kings cannot command ill or
unlawful things, and whatsoever ill event succeed,
the executioners of such designs must answer for
them.”</p>

<p>And now the issue was fairly set, and the battle
begun between Charles and the House of Commons.
In that year, 1626, no man in England could foretell
the result.</p>

<p>Charles, ill-advised to the end, believed he could
overawe the Commons by a display of might, and
was beaten. Twice he had Eliot arrested before the
final imprisonment which ended Eliot’s life.</p>

<p>The loyalty of the House of Commons to its
leader compelled Charles to release Eliot, after sending
him to the Tower for his attack on Buckingham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Then dissolving parliament in June, 1626, and
falling back on a forced loan, the king was met
by wide refusals, and Eliot, with Hampden and
others, suffered imprisonment over this. Eliot was
also deprived of his vice-admiralship and struck off
the roll of justices of the peace.</p>

<p>Driven to call a parliament for the third time in
1628, the king was faced by a stronger opposition
than ever.</p>

<p>Eliot, now member for Cornwall, throughout the
session continued the attack on arbitrary taxation,
and with the lawyers Seldon and Coke carried the
Petition of Right to stop the illegal imprisonments,
the enforced billeting of soldiers, and forced loans.
Buckingham, slain at Portsmouth, no longer troubled
the commonwealth; but Wentworth, ambitious to
use his powers in the service of the government,
had left the popular side for the king; while Laud,
and Weston, the chancellor of the exchequer, were
daily preaching to Charles the divine right of kings
and to his subjects the duty of passive obedience.</p>

<p>The following year both Eliot and Pym attacked
the ecclesiastical policy of Laud. To them the
established religion of England, settled on the Protestant
basis by Elizabeth, was being definitely
changed in a Catholic direction without the sanction
of parliament, and in the very teeth of the opposition
of the House of Commons. High-church
clergymen, like Montague and Mainwaring, holding
to the full a Catholic interpretation of the Book of
Common Prayer, were only censured by the House
of Commons to be promoted by the crown. Laud
preaching a royal supremacy undreamt of by the
great archbishops before Henry VIII., combined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
with it a doctrine of ecclesiastical independence,
owning no allegiance to Rome, equally novel.</p>

<p>Eliot, stoical in his beliefs, and Pym, whose Calvinism
was tempered by common sense, regarded
with horror the revival in the Church of England of
Catholic doctrines concerning the sacraments and
the priesthood. They had done what they could to
check any indulgence to Roman Catholics in
England, and it was monstrous to them that the
Church of England, whose formularies and ritual
had been defined by parliament for the maintenance
of Protestantism, should be expanded to reintroduce
doctrines and practices essentially Catholic. But
for the time the House of Commons was powerless
in the matter, and only sixteen years later was Laud
to expiate on the scaffold his Anglo-Catholicism,
dying a veritable martyr for the high Anglican
doctrine. “None have gone about to break parliaments
but in the end parliaments have broken
them,” declared Eliot on March 2nd, 1629, and
Laud, no less than Charles and Wentworth, was to
prove the truth of the warning.</p>

<p>If parliament could do nothing in that year, 1629,
to stop Laud’s policy, it could at least defend the
privileges of its members. The goods of John
Rolle, M.P., had been seized by the king’s officers
because their owner had refused to pay tonnage and
poundage on demand, and at once Eliot was up in
arms in defence of the privileges of his fellow
member, whose liberties had been interfered with.</p>

<p>Pym was for a wider view of the matter—objecting
to the question being narrowed down to a breach
of privilege. “The liberties of this House,” he
argued, “are inferior to the liberties of this kingdom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
To determine the privilege of this House is
but a mean matter, and the main end is to establish
possession of the subjects, and to take off the commission
and records and orders that are against us.”
With Pym it was not Rolle, the member, who had
been ill-used, but Rolle the British subject, and it
was for the liberties of the subject he strove, holding
the freedom of parliament as but a means to that end.</p>

<p>Eliot, a House of Commons man, through and
through, saw in the welfare of parliament the
welfare of the nation, and stuck to his point, carrying
the House with him, that the privileges of a
member extended to his goods. To this Charles
sent word that what had been done had been done
by his authority. The only question now was, how
long would it be before the king dissolved parliament.</p>

<p>On the second of March, when the House met,
the speaker’s first word was that the king had
ordered an adjournment till the tenth, and that no
business could be transacted. Eliot insisted on
moving his resolutions, and the speaker was held
down in his chair. Then the serjeant-at-arms
attempted to remove the mace, and was promptly
stopped, while the key of the House was turned
from within.</p>

<p>Eliot moved his declaration, beginning with the
famous words: “By the ancient laws and liberties of
England, it is the known birthright and inheritance
of the subject, that no tax, tallage, or other charge
shall be levied or imposed but by common consent
in England; and that the subsidies of tonnage and
poundage are no way due or payable but by a free
gift and special act of parliament.”</p>

<p>The resolutions were carried with loud shouts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
assent, two members guarding the speaker, and the
door was flung open; the sitting was over.</p>

<p>A royal proclamation for dissolving parliament
followed on the fourth of March, and Eliot, with eight
other members, was summoned to appear before the
Privy Council.</p>

<p>From the hour of that summons John Eliot’s liberty
was over, and not for eleven years was England to
have another parliament.</p>

<p>For the fourth time Eliot was a prisoner. He
declined altogether to give an account of what he
had said in parliament, or to acknowledge any right
of interference with the proceedings in parliament.
To the crown lawyers his reply was to stand on the
privileges of a member of the House of Commons.
“I refuse to answer,” he said, “because I hold that
it is against the privilege of parliament to speak of
anything which is done in the House.” He insisted
that he was accountable to the House alone, and
that no other power existed with a constitutional
right to inquire into his conduct there.</p>

<p>At the end of October Eliot was removed from
the Tower to the Marshalsea, and then in January,
1630, he was charged in the King’s Bench with two
other members, Holles and Valentine, with conspiring
to resist the king’s lawful order, to calumniate
ministers of the crown, and to assault the speaker.
Again Eliot refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction.
He was fined £2,000, and sent back to the Tower.</p>

<p>To the last Eliot’s loyalty to the House of
Commons remained unshaken. He had but to
acknowledge that he had done wrong, to admit that
he had offended, and the prison doors would have
opened to him. But to make this acknowledgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
was to deny the sacred liberty of parliament, to
admit wrong was to betray the House of Commons.
To John Eliot the welfare of the House of Commons
was a national cause—dearer than life. To
betray its honour was to betray the State. The
loyalty of John Eliot to the House of Commons was
interwoven with his devotion to the State, but it
was something England had never seen before, and
never saw again. “He learned to believe, as no
other man believed before or after him, in the
representatives of the nation.” (Gardiner.)</p>

<p>The character and temperament of Eliot must be
taken into account in understanding this passionate
belief in the House of Commons. It was not as a
great thinker but as a great orator he had risen to
the leadership of the House of Commons. He saw
in his mind, as no other man saw at the time, a perfectly
balanced constitution of king, lords, and
commons. In parliament was the best wisdom of
the country placed at the service of the crown. In
the crown was the appointed ruler who, with his
ministers, had but to come to parliament for advice
and counsel. So it seemed to John Eliot; and
single-minded himself, he could not realise that in
the House of Commons were plenty of men of but
passing honesty, and that Charles and Laud and
Wentworth were fundamentally opposed to his views
of constitutional government, and bitterly hostile to
the growing powers of the commons.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>Months passed, and John Eliot’s health gave
way in the confinement in the Tower, but his
steadfastness was unchanged. He corresponded
with his friend John Hampden, wrote his treatise
on the <cite>Monarchy of Man</cite>, and calmly awaited his
end. An application on behalf of his friends and
his son for Eliot’s release was made in October, 1622,
on the ground that “the doctors were of opinion he
could never recover of his consumption until such
time as he might breathe in purer air.” The reply
of Chief Justice Richardson was “that, although
Sir John were brought low in body, yet was he as
high and lofty in mind as ever; for he would
neither submit to the king nor to the justice of that
court.”</p>

<p>On November 27th, 1632, the spirit of John
Eliot, unbroken by captivity, passed from the body
his gaolers had deprived of life. A last appeal from
his son to the king for the removal of his father’s
body into Cornwall, there to lie with those of his
ancestors at Port Eliot, received the curt refusal,
“Let Sir John Eliot’s body be buried in the church
of the parish where he died.” And so he was
buried in the Tower, and no stone marks the spot
where he lies.</p>

<p>John Eliot was but forty-two when he laid down
his life for the principle of parliamentary government.</p>

<p>Any satisfaction that might have been felt by
Charles and Laud at the death of the foremost
antagonist to their policy of absolutism was fleeting.
For if Eliot was dead, the cause he had championed
with such conspicuous sincerity and courage was
alive, and John Hampden and John Pym were at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
hand to carry on the fight till Cromwell and his
Ironsides were ready to end the battle.</p>

<p>Charles was determined that, until the commons
should be more submissive, he would call no parliament,
but would govern through his ministers alone.
The difficulty was to find money.</p>

<p>In 1634 London and the seaports were persuaded
to furnish supplies for ships on the pretext that
piracy must be prevented. A year later and the
demand was extended to the inland counties, and
John Hampden, taking his stand on the Petition of
Right which Charles had granted in 1628, declined
to pay. Ten out of twelve of the king’s judges had
decided that ship-money might be enforced if the
kingdom appeared to be in danger, but against this
declared legality there was the decree of parliament
forbidding forced loans or taxes without parliamentary
sanction.</p>

<p>On this resistance of the ship-money Hampden’s
fame has been chiefly built up. The amount was
small—only a matter of some twenty shillings—the
issue was of a first importance. It was clear to
Hampden that if the king could raise money by
such methods, what need would there be in the
royal mind for the calling of parliament at all? The
question was forced upon him: Was parliament an
essential part of the constitution? The judges had
declared ship-money was legal, other taxation and
forced loans could easily find justification on the
judicial bench, and thus the crown obtain its revenue,
and England ruled without any let or hindrance from
its citizens. To admit the position was to see the
work of centuries undone, and the old contest in the
land for liberties in return for taxes abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>

<p>Hampden’s refusal to pay ship-money was a
declaration for parliamentary government. No
more a republican than Eliot or Pym, Hampden
could see that either crown or parliament must be
supreme in the affairs of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> The constitution
was not to be balanced so evenly as Eliot had
believed. Eliot himself had been deprived of life
for maintaining, not the supremacy but the liberty of
parliament. For John Hampden the evils of royal
supremacy were obvious and present: misrule, the
restoration of a religion banished by authority of
crown and parliament, and disliked and feared by
the majority of serious-minded people in the country,
and the imprisonment of all who claimed the old
freedom of parliament.</p>

<p>The case was decided against him in the law
courts, but five of the twelve judges supported
Hampden’s contention that the resistance to payment
was valid, and the arguments for his defence
were published far and wide. “The judgment
proved of more advantage and credit to the gentleman
condemned than to the king’s service.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>Three years later, and Charles was forced to
summon parliament to get money for his war in
Scotland—the “Bishop’s War,” perhaps the most
hopeless of all his ventures.</p>

<p>Parliament met in April, and its temper was so
unfavourable to the desires of the king, for the
forcible conversion of the Scots to episcopacy, that
it was dissolved in three weeks. John Pym was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
notable in that “Short Parliament” as the spokesman
of the aggrieved country party, and the commons
decided that the grievances of the nation must be
considered before supplies were voted. The Scotch
war was intolerable to Pym and Hampden. They
had no objection to episcopacy as long as bishops
were men of Protestant convictions. It was Laud
the “Anglo-Catholic,” Laud the preacher of the
divine right of kings, not Laud the Archbishop of
Canterbury, whom they detested, and they had no
relish for the expenditure of English life and
treasure in the forcing of Laudian doctrine on
Protestant Scotland.</p>

<p>In the long eleven years of silence from the utterance
of parliament things had been going steadily
from bad to worse in England, Pym made out.
Naturally conservative in mind, seeing in the constitution
of king and parliament an admirable
instrument of government, and in the Established
Church of England an excellent expression of the
Protestant religion, Pym had found that with
parliament suspended the Protestantism of the
Established Church had been steadily undermined
by Laud’s policy, and the revival of some estranged
Catholic doctrines and practices had proceeded
apace. Without parliament there was no security
for national well-being. “Powers of parliament are
to the body politic as rational faculties of the soul
to man,” he declares in April, 1640.</p>

<p>Pym had entered the House of Commons with
Eliot in 1614, and had been imprisoned in that year
for his boldness. In 1620 he had been one of the
“twelve ambassadors” to James I., for whom that
king had ordered chairs to be set in Whitehall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
With Eliot and Hampden he had pressed for
Buckingham’s impeachment and for the Petition of
Right. Now in 1640, John Pym, in his fifty-sixth
year, was about to become the accredited leader of
the parliamentary party, to be called “King Pym”
by his enemies at the court, and to pass away when
the long constitutional struggle was being settled on
the field of civil war. Unimaginative, and averse
from new ideas, Pym had a quite clear perception
of the business of the House of Commons, and of
the fitting relations of king and parliament. The
crown, the lords, the commons were all recognized
and necessary elements in the constitution, but their
importance was not equal. The collective assembly
of parliament had prevailed over the crown more
than once; to Pym, the Laudian “divine right”
was a novelty, and nonsense at that. Parliament
could do much of its work with or without royal
approval, and of the two Houses, if the Lords
were unwilling to work with the lower House, the
Commons could “save the kingdom alone.”</p>

<p>In the autumn Charles was driven again to appeal
to parliament, and in November, 1640, the “Long
Parliament” met, only to be dissolved thirteen
years later by the arms of Cromwell. To the
eleven years of “personal government” by Charles
succeed thirteen years of parliamentary government,
and then the House of Commons, now too
enfeebled to endure, itself goes down before a
military dictatorship.</p>

<p>Pym anticipated the coming struggle by riding
over England on the eve of the elections to the
Long Parliament and urging the electors to return
men to the House of Commons resolute and alive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
to the crisis. The response was unmistakable.
Parliament assembled to find some remedy for the
distresses of the country before voting any money
for the purposes of the crown. Enormous numbers
of petitions were presented, and the House of
Commons appointed its committees to attend to
and report on the complaints.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>Before the year closed the House of Commons
had struck at the power of Laud and Wentworth
(now the Earl of Strafford), and the two ministers
lay in prison impeached for high treason. Windebank,
Charles’s secretary of state, and Finch, the
chancellor, were already fled over seas.</p>

<p>It was Pym who went to the bar of the House of
Lords to summon Strafford to surrender, and it was
Pym who opened the charge of impeachment the
following March. As in Eliot’s time, Hampden is
content to be overshadowed by his friend, though
his was the greater influence in the House.</p>

<p>Clarendon has given us his view of Hampden at
the opening of the Long Parliament:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When this parliament began the eyes of all men were fixed
upon him, as their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">patriae pater</i>, and the pilot that must steer
the vessel through the tempests and rocks which threatened
it. I am persuaded his power and interest at that time were
greater to do good or hurt than any man’s in the kingdom, or
than any man of his rank hath had in any time; for his reputation
of honesty was universal, and his affections seemed
so publicly guided, that no corrupt or private ends could bias
them.</p></div>

<p>Baxter, it may be recalled, had written in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
<cite>Saints’ Rest</cite> that one of the pleasures which he
hoped to enjoy in heaven was the society of John
Hampden. The name of Hampden was blotted
out in the copies published after the Restoration.
“But,” wrote Baxter, “I must tell the reader that I
did blot it out, not as changing my opinion of the
person.”</p>

<p>The work of Pym and Hampden is conspicuous
at the beginning of the Long Parliament. The
Star Chamber and High Commission Courts are
abolished. Ship-money and all enforced taxation
unauthorised by parliament are declared illegal.
Oliver Cromwell’s motion for annual parliaments is
amended into an act for triennial parliaments to be
called with or without royal summons. Strafford—the
only strong minister Charles had—perished on
Tower Hill in May, both Pym and Hampden supporting
impeachment instead of attainder, and
voting for the fallen minister to be allowed the use
of counsel at his trial. That Strafford was a
criminal and a traitor ready to use his Irish army
for the suppression of the English parliament Pym
had no doubt.</p>

<p>Still Charles would not admit the position lost,
and still struggled to govern, not through parliament,
but by personal rule. The death of Strafford,
though approved by all supporters of the House of
Commons, rallied the king’s friends. The House of
Lords was no longer quite at one with the Commons
in the contest. In the House of Commons a
royalist party emerges to oppose Pym, and the
beginning of party government is seen. Overtures
are made by Pym to the queen—to be disregarded,
of course; though the tide is setting towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
revolution, yet Pym and Hampden are far from
revolutionaries. They are willing to end the political
power of the bishops by turning them out of the
House of Lords, but have only moderate sympathy
with the root-and-branch Puritans who would abolish
episcopacy.</p>

<p>In the Grand Remonstrance which Pym laid
before the House of Commons in November, 1641,
the case for the Parliament was stated with frankness,
but the demands were not revolutionary. The
main points were securities for the administration of
justice, and insistence on the responsibility of the
king’s ministers to parliament. The royalists fought
the Remonstrance vigorously, and in the end it was
only carried by a majority of eleven, 159 to 148.
At the end of the debate the excitement was intense:
“some waved their hats over their heads, and others
took their swords in their scabbards out of their
belts, and held them by the pummels in their hands,
setting the lower part on the ground.” Violence
seemed inevitable, “had not the sagacity and great
calmness of Mr. Hampden, by a short speech,
prevented it.”</p>

<p>On the 1st of December the Remonstrance, with
a petition for the removal of grievances, especially
in matters of religion, was presented to the king at
Hampton Court. “Charles had now a last chance
of regaining the affection of his people. If he could
have resolved to give his confidence to the leaders
of the moderate party in the House of Commons,
and to regulate his proceedings by their advice, he
might have been, not, indeed, as he had been, a
despot, but the powerful and respected king of a free
people. The nation might have enjoyed liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
and repose under a government with Falkland
at its head, checked by a constitutional opposition
under the conduct of Hampden. It was not necessary
that, in order to accomplish this happy end,
the king should sacrifice any part of his lawful
prerogative, or submit to any conditions inconsistent
with his dignity.” So Macaulay wrote. But the
days of “governments” and “constitutional oppositions”
were far off in 1641, and only the germ of
party government is seen in the division of the
House of Commons. To “submit to any conditions”
from parliament was inconsistent with the
king’s notions of royal dignity, fostered by Laud to
reject all criticisms as denials of the absolutism of
the crown.</p>

<p>Charles promised an answer to the deputation
which waited on him, and the answer was seen on
January 3, 1642, when the king’s attorney appeared
at the bar of the Lords, impeached Pym, Hampden,
Holles, Strode, and Hazlerig of high treason, in
having corresponded with the Scots for the invasion
of England, and demanded the surrender of the
five members. “All constitutional law was set
aside by a charge which proceeded personally from
the king, which deprived the accused of their legal
right to a trial by their peers, and summoned them
before a tribunal which had no pretence to a jurisdiction
over them.”</p>

<p>The House of Commons simply declined to
surrender their members, but promised to take the
matter into consideration.</p>

<p>Then Charles, with some three hundred cavaliers,
went to Westminster, and entered the House of
Commons to demand the accused. But the five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
members, warned of his coming, were out of the
way and safe within the city of London. “It was
believed that if the king had found them there, and
called in his guards to have seized them, the members
of the House would have endeavoured the defence
of them, which might have proved a very unhappy
and sad business.” As it was, the king could only
retire discomfited, with some words about respecting
the laws of the realm and the privileges of parliament,
and “in a more discontented and angry passion
than he came in.”</p>

<p>The invasion of the Commons was the worst move
Charles could have made, for parliament was in no
temper favourable to royal encroachments, and it
had a large population at hand ready to give substantial
support. The city of London at once
declared for the House of Commons, ignored the
king’s writs for the arrest of the five members, and
answered the royal proclamation declaring them
“traitors” by calling out the trained bands for the
escort of the members back to Westminster, and for
the protection of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Falkland and the royalist members turned for the
moment from Charles at his unexpected attack on
the House, the cavaliers of Whitehall, menaced by
the trained bands from Southwark and the city,
fled, and Charles, standing alone, left London.</p>

<p>War was now imminent. Pym and Hampden at
once prepared for the struggle.</p>

<p>Pym secured the arsenals of Portsmouth and Hull
for the parliament, but his efforts to obtain the control
of the militia in the counties were frustrated for
a time by the king’s natural refusal to consent to
the Militia Bill, which would have placed troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
under the orders of country gentlemen of the
parliamentary party.</p>

<p>Both king and parliament had to break through
all constitutional precedent. The king levied troops
by a royal commission, and Pym got an ordinance
of both Houses of Parliament passed appointing
the lords-lieutenant to command the militia, and
thereby published the supremacy of parliament over
the crown. In April the king appeared at Hull to
obtain arms, and was refused admission to the town
by Sir John Hotham, the governor. Parliament
expressed its approval of Hotham’s act, the royalists
gathered round Charles at York, and the final proposals
of parliament for ending absolute monarchy
were rejected by the king in June with the words,
“If I granted your demands I should be no more
than the mere phantom of a king.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>With this refusal all negotiations were broken off.
Essex was appointed commander of the parliamentary
army, and in August Charles raised the
royal standard at Nottingham, and war was begun.</p>

<p>Hampden threw himself vigorously into the campaign.
From his native county of Buckingham,
the county which made him its representative in
parliament in 1640, he raised a regiment of infantry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
“His neighbours eagerly enlisted under his command.
His men were known by their green
uniform, and by their standard, which bore on one
side the watchword of the parliament, ‘God with
us,’ and on the other the device of Hampden,
‘<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vestigia nulla retrorsum</i>.’” In the first stages of
the war, before any decisive blow had been struck,
Hampden was busy passing and repassing between
the army and the parliament. Clarendon praises
his courage and ability on the field.</p>

<p>A skirmish at Chalgrove, on June 18th, 1643,
between bodies of horse commanded by Rupert
and by Hampden, ended in victory for the royalists.
Hampden was seen riding off the field, “before the
action was done, which he never used to do, and
with his head hanging down, and resting his hands
upon the neck of his horse.” He was mortally
wounded, for two carbine balls were lodged in his
shoulder, and reached Thame only to die six days
later.</p>

<p>The death of Hampden—at the age of 49—came
at a dark hour in the early fortunes of the
parliamentary army, and deepened the gloom.
“The loss of Colonel Hampden goeth near the
heart of every man that loves the good of his king
and country, and makes some conceive little content
to be at the army now that he is gone.” But Pym
remained, and Cromwell and Vane, and many
another resolute House of Commons man.</p>

<p>Pym’s health was already broken when Hampden
fell, but he lived to accomplish the alliance of the
English Puritans and the Scotch army, and, as the
price of this alliance, the abolition of episcopacy
and the adoption of Presbyterianism in the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
of England. The Solemn League and Covenant
was accepted by parliament, and imposed on the
nation in September. Henceforth the parliamentary
army was pledged to extirpate “Popery, prelacy,
superstition, schism and profaneness”; to bring “the
Churches of God in the three kingdoms to the
nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion”; to
“preserve the rights and privileges of the parliament
and the liberties of the kingdom; and to
unite the two kingdoms in a firm peace and union to
all posterity.”</p>

<p>The taking of the covenant—a political necessity—was
John Pym’s last work. He was ten years
older than Hampden, and his character was ruggeder
and sterner and without the charm of the younger
man. But Pym’s was the greater genius in politics,
and his scheme of constitutional government was to
be fulfilled in England at a later season.</p>

<p>John Pym died on December 8th, 1643, and his
body was buried in Westminster Abbey—only to be
turned out at the Restoration and removed to St.
Margaret’s churchyard.</p>

<p>With Pym and Hampden gone, henceforth the
conduct of parliament was in other hands, and the
day of moderate statesmanship had passed.</p>

<p>The war undertaken to preserve the liberties and
establish the supremacy of the House of Commons
was to bring in its train not only the abolition of
monarchy and the House of Lords, but the suppression
of the House of Commons itself.</p>

<p>Important to the nation as the issues at stake
were, most people in England took hardly any
more part or interest in the great civil war than they
had done in the Wars of the Roses. “A very large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
number of persons regarded the struggle with
indifference.... In one case, the inhabitants
of an entire county pledged themselves to remain
neutral. Many quietly changed with the times
(as people changed with the varying fortunes of
York and Lancaster). That this sentiment of
neutrality was common to the greater mass of the
working classes is obvious from the simultaneous
appearance of the club men in different parts of the
country, with their motto, ‘If you take our cattle, we
will give you battle.’”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>How could it be otherwise? Supremacy of King,
or supremacy of Commons,—seed time and harvest
remain, and the labourer and the artizan must needs
do their day’s work.</p>

<p>Not till the deposing of the Stuarts—forty-five
years after John Hampden’s death—is the supremacy
of parliament over the crown arrived at by general
consent, to become a recognized and settled thing
in British politics. By the middle of the nineteenth
century the House of Commons is unmistakably the
ruling power in the constitution, and the labours of
Eliot, Hampden and Pym are vindicated.</p>

<p>In our own day changes in the balance of constitutional
power may be noted. The supremacy of
the House of Commons is quietly disappearing
before the growing popularity of the crown, the reawakened
activity of the House of Lords, and the
steady gathering of the reins of power into the hands
of the Cabinet and Executive. As the crown in
the last twenty years has increased in popular
esteem, so the influence and importance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
Commons has waned in the country; and this
waning influence of the Lower House has been
further diminished by the frequent rejection and
revision of its measures by the House of
Lords.</p>

<p>The power of the Executive has also been
obtained at the expense of the power of the
Commons. The Cabinet, rather than the House of
Commons, holds the supremacy to-day, and the
direction of foreign policy, and the making of international
treaties are no more within the authority of
the House of Commons than are the administration
of Egypt and India. Pym and Hampden fought
and gave their lives for the right of the House of
Commons to control the ministers of the crown and
to order the policy of these ministers. By its own
consent, and not from pressure from without, the
House of Commons has silently surrendered this
right, and has agreed that the policy of its Foreign
Minister for the time being—whether he be Liberal
or Conservative—must not be subject to reproof,
still less to correction. In home affairs administrative
order steadily supersedes statute law.</p>

<p>In theory ministers are still subject to the House
of Commons. In actual practice they can rely on
not being interfered with as long as their party has a
majority in the House. When the price of effective
interference with the conduct of affairs is a defeat
of the Cabinet and a consequent dissolution, the
payment is more than members of parliament are
prepared to make.</p>

<p>Given the sense of security of social order and of
the administration of justice, the nation, generally,
no more heeds the passing of the supremacy from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
House of Commons, than it heeded the winning of
that supremacy.</p>

<p>The Laudian doctrine in the Church of England,
revived at the Restoration, disappeared with the
passing of the non-jurors at the close of the seventeenth
century. But its Anglo-Catholic teaching
was renewed by the Oxford Movement, early in
Queen Victoria’s reign, and has largely changed the
whole appearance of the Church of England. The
modern high Anglican, claiming, as Laud claimed,
the right to interpret the Book of Common Prayer
as a Catholic document, but no longer the advocate
of any theory of divine right of kings, or the
champion of any particular political creed, has
travelled indeed far beyond Laud’s very limited
success in winning support for Catholic doctrine and
ritual in the Church of England. Laud was beaten
by the opposition of parliament; his present day
successors in the Church of England have prospered
in spite of that opposition, and have triumphed over
acts of parliaments, adverse judicial sentences,
privations and imprisonments. But with Laud the
movement was directed by bishops and approved
by the king, the modern Laudian movement was
banned by bishops and disfavoured by all in high
authority.</p>

<p>To-day nearly every Catholic doctrine, save papal
supremacy, has its expounders and defenders in the
Church of England, and Catholic rites and ceremonies
are freely practised.</p>

<p>Laud, dying on the scaffold in 1645 at the hands
of parliament, is amply avenged in the twentieth
century by the victorious high-churchman. The
Laudian clergy of the Established Church can now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
maintain their Anglo-Catholic faith and practice,
without any fear of parliamentary interference. For
generally they enjoy a popularity and respect that
the House of Commons does not willingly venture
to assail.</p>

<h3 class="left">JOHN LILBURNE AND<br />
THE LEVELLERS
<span class="subhead">1647–1653.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">From</span> his coming of age in 1637 till the near
approach of death, when he turned, a dying
man, to the peaceful tenets of the Quakers,
the life of John Lilburne is a record of
twenty years of strife and battle with the rulers
of the land.</p>

<p>He came of pugnacious stock, for John Lilburne’s
father, a well-to-do Durham squire, was the last
man to demand the settlement of a lawsuit by the
ordeal of battle, and came into court armed accordingly—only
to be disappointed by an order from the
crown, forbidding the proposed return to such
ancient and obsolete methods of deciding the
differences of neighbours.</p>

<p>Apprenticed to a wholesale cloth-merchant in
London, John Lilburne soon became acquainted
with Bastwick and Prynne, then busy over anti-episcopal
pamphlets, and, keeping such company,
naturally fell into the clutches of the Star Chamber.
The charge against him was that he had helped to
print and circulate unlicensed books, in particular,
Prynne’s <cite>News from Ipswich</cite>; and though Lilburne
declared the charge to be false, on his refusal to
take the usual oath to answer truly all questions put
to him, the Star Chamber adjudged him guilty, and
passed sentence—Lilburne was to be whipped from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
the Fleet to Westminster, to stand in the pillory,
and to be kept in prison.</p>

<p>The sentence was carried out on February 13th,
1638, but Lilburne was not cowed, for he scattered
some of Bastwick’s offending pamphlets on the
road, and was gagged in the pillory to reduce him
to silence. In prison things went hardly with
Lilburne, for the authorities had him placed in irons
and kept in solitary confinement, and only the
compassion of fellow prisoners saved him from actual
starvation in the two years and nine months of his
imprisonment.</p>

<p>It was a rough beginning, and John Lilburne
was henceforth an agitator and a rebel.</p>

<p>At the end of 1640 one of the first things done
by the Long Parliament was to order Lilburne’s
release, and in the following May the sentence was
pronounced “illegal and against the liberties of the
subject.” But illegal or not, the punishment had
been inflicted, and with unbroken spirit, passionately
resenting the tyranny that could so wrong men,
Lilburne flew quickly to the attack on the authors of
the injustice.</p>

<p>At Edgehill Lilburne held a captain’s commission,
and at Brentford he was taken prisoner by the
royalists. Only the threat of swift reprisals by the
parliamentary army saved him from being shot as
“a traitor,” and the following year he was again at
liberty on an exchange of prisoners. Again, after
fighting at Marston Moor, he fell into the hands of
the royalists, and, shot through the arm, was kept in
prison at Oxford for six months.</p>

<p>Brave soldier as Lilburne was, he left the army
in 1645 (with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
with £880 arrears of pay owing to him) rather than
take the covenant and subscribe to the requirements
of Cromwell’s “new model.”</p>

<p>And now monarchy having fallen from its high
estate, Lilburne at once saw elements of tyranny in
the Parliamentary government, and did not hesitate
to say so. Courageous and intrepid, with considerable
legal knowledge, a passion for liberty, and clear
views on democracy, John Lilburne might have
given invaluable service to the commonwealth. He
had shown skill and daring in the war, his character
for fearless endurance had been proved, his ability as
a pamphleteer was considerable, and his capacity
for work enormous; the government had either to
treat Lilburne as a friend or foe—he was not to
be ignored. The government, unwisely, decided
Lilburne was an enemy, and for the next ten years
he fought the rule of parliament and the army, his
popularity increasing with every new pamphlet he
produced. The price the commonwealth government
paid for its opposition to Lilburne was to
be seen on the death of Cromwell.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>From 1645 to 1649 Lilburne’s vigorous criticisms
of the men in power provoked retaliation, and
brought him to Newgate. But in prison or out of
prison Lilburne went on hammering away to establish
a democratic constitution. The time was to come
when Cromwell would find the Long Parliament
had outlived its usefulness and would end it by main
force. Lilburne was anxious in 1647 for a radical
reform of parliament and a general manhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
suffrage. His proposals were popular in the army,
and had Cromwell supported him the whole future
of English politics would have been changed.</p>

<p>When the Presbyterian majority in parliament
proposed the disbandment of the army in 1647, the
regiments chose their agitators, and, refusing to
disband, drew up the “Agreement of the People”
and the “Case for the Army.” These documents
give the political standpoint of the Levellers and the
particular grievances to be remedied.</p>

<p>The distribution of parliamentary seats according
to the number of inhabitants was the chief proposal
in the “Agreement of the People,” and the principles
maintained are that “no man is bound to a government
under which he has not put himself,” and that
“all inhabitants who have not lost their birthright
should have an equal voice in elections.”</p>

<p>The particular demands in the “Case for the
Army” were the abolition of monopolies, freedom
of trade and religion, restoration of enclosed common
lands, and abolition of sinecures.</p>

<p>While Cromwell and Ireton were both bitterly
against manhood suffrage, the council of officers to
whom the Levellers appealed agreed to support it,
without approving the rest of the programme.</p>

<p>Cromwell, relying on the army to prevent a
royalist reaction—for Charles was plotting from
Carisbrooke for aid from Scotland, and the royalists
in the House of Commons were anxious to effect a
reconciliation—would give neither time nor patience
to the demands of Lilburne and the Levellers.</p>

<p>In vain the Levellers exclaimed, in 1648, “We
were ruled before by King, Lords, and Commons,
now by a General, Court Martial, and Commons:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
and, we pray you, what is the difference?” Cromwell,
at all costs, was determined to preserve the
discipline of the army, and to suppress mutiny with
an iron hand. For him the army which had beaten
the cavaliers was the one safeguard against the
return of the old order in Church and State. Lilburne
and the Levellers, with the “Fifth Monarchy” men,
had been the strength, the very life of the army that
had conquered at Marston Moor and Naseby. The
petition of the Fifth Monarchy men for the reign of
Christ and His saints (which, according to prophecy,
was to supersede the four monarchies of the ancient
world) had no terrors for Cromwell; in other words,
they demanded government exclusively by the godly,
Independents and Presbyterians combining to elect
all representatives, “and to determine all things
by the Word.” “Such a proposal might attract
fanatics; it could not attract the multitude. The
Levellers who stood up for an exaggeration of the
doctrine of parliamentary supremacy were likely to
be far more numerous.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> To Cromwell the immediate
thing was the royalist danger; it was no season
for embarking on democratic experiments with which
he had no sympathy. The breach between Cromwell
and the Levellers widened, and as Cromwell
became more and more impatient of their agitation,
distrust and suspicion of Cromwell and of the newly-appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
Council of State ripened, in 1649, into
revolt.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> It is the perennial misunderstanding between
the statesman and the agitator. The one weighted
by responsibility can rarely travel at the pace of the
other, untrammelled by office, and as the distance
between the two lengthens, it seems they are not
even pursuing the same course—as, indeed, very
often they are not.</p>

<p>Lilburne had none of Cromwell’s anxieties as to
a possible royalist reaction; for him the danger
could not come from the dethroned king and his
defeated cavaliers, but from a parliamentary oligarchy
or a military dictatorship. But he overestimated
the strength of the Leveller movement in the army.
With the presentation of the “Agreement of the
People” the bulk of the discontent in the army
diminished, and while the Levellers who remained
became in several regiments openly mutinous, the
movement generally died down, so that when the
revolt came, it was suppressed without difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>Lilburne was out of prison at the beginning of
1649. He took no part in the trial of Charles I.,
and let it be known that he doubted the wisdom of
abolishing monarchy before a new constitution had
been drawn up.</p>

<p>As neither the remnant of the Long Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
nor Cromwell and Fairfax were doing anything to
set up this new constitution, Lilburne proceeded to
lay a remonstrance before parliament, and to follow
this up by his two pamphlets on “England’s New
Chains.” He now urged that “committees of short
continuance” should supersede the Council of State,
that the Self-denying Ordinance should be put in
force, “seeing how dangerous it was for one and the
same persons to be continued long in the highest
commands of a military power,”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> that a new parliament
should be elected, and the “Agreement of the
People” proceeded with heartily. At the same time
he called for army reform by a reconstruction of the
General Council and the election of agitators.</p>

<p>The expulsion of five troopers from the army for
directly petitioning parliament provoked another
pamphlet—“The Hunting of the Foxes from Newmarket
to Whitehall by five small beagles late of
the army.” The argument here was that Cromwell,
Ireton, and Harrison ruled the council of officers,
and that the council of officers ruled parliament and
the nation. “The old king’s person and the old
lords are but removed, and a new king and new
lords with the commons are in one House, and so
we are under a more absolute arbitrary monarchy
than before.”</p>

<p>There was only one answer to be made to
Lilburne’s pen, and that was to arrest the man who
held it, for the commonwealth had no one on its
side who could reply to him. At the end of March
Lilburne and three of his supporters, Walwyn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Prince, and Richard Overton were arrested as
traitors, “England’s New Chains” having been voted
by parliament seditious and destructive of the
government, and were committed to the Tower to
await trial.</p>

<p>At once a petition was got up and signed by
80,000 persons for Lilburne’s release, and a fortnight
later—April 18th—another petition was taken
to the bar of the House of Commons to the same
effect. Parliament promised that the prisoners
should have a legal trial, but declared the course of
justice must not be interfered with. A large deputation
of women also appeared at Westminster on
April 23rd with a similar petition; but these were
forbidden to enter the House, and, admonished by
members to “go home and wash their dishes,”
answered they would soon have no dishes to wash.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>Lilburne was not brought to trial till October, and
in the six months’ interval, though the output of
democratic pamphlets continued from the Tower,
the Leveller movement in the army ended in open
mutiny and defeat.</p>

<p>Carlyle tells the story accurately enough of the
mutiny in Whalley’s regiment in Bishopsgate,
London, on April 25th:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They want this and that; they seize their colours from the
cornet, who is lodged at the “Bull” there; the general
(Fairfax) and lieutenant-general (Cromwell) have to hasten
thither, quell them, pack them forth on their march, seizing
fifteen of them first to be tried by court-martial. Tried by
instant court-martial, five of them are found guilty, doomed
to die, but pardoned; and one of them, Trooper Lockyer, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
doomed and not pardoned.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Trooper Lockyer is shot in
Paul’s Churchyard on the morrow. A very brave young man,
they say; though but three-and-twenty. “He has served
seven years in these wars,” ever since the wars began.
“Religious,” too, “of excellent parts and much beloved”;
but with hot notions as to human freedom, and the rate at
which the milleniums are attainable. Poor Lockyer! He
falls shot in Paul’s Churchyard on Friday, amid the tears of
men and women. Lockyer’s corpse is watched and wept
over, not without prayer, in the eastern regions of the city,
till a new week come; and on Monday, this is what we see
advancing westward by way of funeral to him:</p>

<p>About one thousand went before the corpse, five or six in a
file; the corpse was then brought, with six trumpets sounding
a soldier’s knell, then the trooper’s horse came, clothed
all over in mourning, and led by a footman. The corpse was
adorned with bundles of rosemary, one half stained in blood,
and the sword of the deceased along with them. Some
thousands followed in ranks and files, all had sea-green and
black ribbon tied on their hats and to their breasts, and the
women brought up the rear.</p>

<p>At the new churchyard at Westminster some thousands
more of the better sort met them, who thought not fit to
march through the city. Many looked upon this funeral as
an affront to parliament and the army; others called these
people “Levellers”; but they took no notice of any of them.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p></div>

<p>In May one Corporal William Thompson rallied
a body of Levellers at Banbury, published a manifesto
called “England’s Standard Advanced,” and
inveighed against the tyranny of courts-martial.
Overwhelmed by force of numbers, Thompson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
escaped, and later died fighting alone near Wellingborough.
Some twenty of his followers joined the
mutineers of Scrope’s regiment at Salisbury. Numbering
some 1,200, these Levellers made their way
by Marlborough and Wantage to Burford. Here
Cromwell came up with the mutineers, and surprised
them at midnight. Resistance was hopeless,
and the majority at once surrendered. All were
pardoned except Cornet Thompson (brother to
William), and two corporals—Church and Perkins—who
showed neither fear nor admitted any wrong
on their part. These three men were shot in
Burford churchyard on May 15th,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and with their
deaths the Leveller movement was at an end.</p>

<p>But Lilburne was unsubdued. His new “Agreement
of the Free People,” published on May 1st,
called for annual parliaments elected by manhood
suffrage—pensioners, militant royalists, and lawyers
excluded—and for the free election of unendowed
church ministers in each parish. At the same time
he disclaimed all connection with Winstanley’s
“Diggers”—political reform was Lilburne’s
demand.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>Released on bail in July, Lilburne issued in
August an “Impeachment for High Treason against
Oliver Cromwell and his son-in-law, James Ireton.”
In this his hatred of government by the army
compels the admission that monarchy is preferable
to a military despotism: “If we must have a king,
I for my part would rather have the prince than any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
man in the world.... For the present army
to set up the pretended Saint Oliver or any other as
their elected king, there will be nothing thereby
from the beginning of the chapter to the end
thereof but wars and the cutting of throats year
after year; yea, and the absolute keeping up of a
perpetual army under which the people are absolute
and perfect slaves.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, instead of bringing him to trial, the
government merely issued a warrant for Lilburne’s
arrest. The agitator met this by a stronger
manifesto, “An Outcry of the Young Men and
Apprentices of London,” calling on the army to rise in
support of a democratic parliament and to vindicate
the men executed at Burford. Some response came
from the garrison at Oxford, who summoned their
officers to join in the demand for a free parliament,
but no success attended this step.</p>

<p>At last in October Lilburne was brought to trial
at the Guildhall, not on the charge for which he had
been first committed to the Tower in March, but
for the “treason” of his later pamphlets. The trial
is memorable for Lilburne’s demand that counsel
should be assigned to him in the event of legal
technicalities arising, and for his bidding the jury
remember they were judges of law as well as of fact.
His real defence lay in the question he had put so
often: Was England to be governed by the sword
and a mock parliament, or by duly elected representatives
of the People? The jury understood
that Lilburne was on trial for putting that question,
and, agreeing with him, they acquitted
him. The verdict was received with tremendous
applause, and “a loud and unanimous shout” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
triumph went up from the citizens of London in the
Guildhall.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>In December Lilburne was elected to the common
council of the city, but parliament promptly declared
the election void. “Fiercely as Lilburne attacked
Cromwell, there was at times considerable liking
between the two men, and they met on friendly
terms before Cromwell went to Scotland in 1650.
Cromwell assured Lilburne of his desire to make
England enjoy the real fruit of all the army’s promises
and declarations,” and friendly relations lasted
till Cromwell’s return. But, in Cromwell’s absence,
Lilburne charged Hazlerigg with corruption in the
administration of justice concerning a disputed
colliery lease in Durham, and parliament took up
the matter. In January, 1652, it declared Lilburne’s
petition for redress a libel, and imposed a fine of
£7,000 with a sentence of banishment for life.</p>

<p>This proceeding by parliament revived the
methods of the Star Chamber in imposing a conviction
and a sentence without trial, but the House
of Commons was determined to stop Lilburne’s
activities at all cost.</p>

<p>Cromwell made no effort to hinder the conviction,
and Lilburne insisted that Cromwell’s professions of
friendship were hypocritical, and that the general
himself was responsible for the sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>For the time Lilburne retired to Holland, where
he discussed favourably the chances of a royalist
restoration. But on the expulsion of the Rump of
the Long Parliament the agitator at once wrote off
to Cromwell for permission to return to England,
and getting no answer crossed to London in June,
1653, and settled in lodgings in Moorfields. He petitioned
Cromwell and the Council of State for leave
to remain unmolested, promising to live peacefully,
but Cromwell, with the whole government on his
shoulders, had no willingness to incur the risk
Lilburne and his doctrine of popular rights involved
to the safety of the State.</p>

<p>Lilburne was promptly arrested by Cromwell’s
order and brought to trial at the Old Bailey on July
13th. The government case was that he had returned
to England knowing that a sentence of death
was decreed by parliament if he broke his exile.</p>

<p>Lilburne’s defence, in the main, was that the
parliament which had passed sentence was dead,
and that if Cromwell had acted justly in dissolving
it, then its unjust actions ought not to be maintained;
if Cromwell had acted unjustly, why was he not
punished?</p>

<p>Again the jury acquitted him, and again the people
of London expressed their satisfaction at the verdict,
“the very soldiers sent to guard the court joining in
the shouts, and beating their drums and sounding
their trumpets as they passed along the streets to
their quarters.”</p>

<p>But “for the peace of the nation” Cromwell
would not let Lilburne be at large. Back in the
Tower, then at Guernsey, and then in Dover Castle
for more than two years Lilburne was a prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

<p>His health was broken in 1656, and consumption
had set in. Death was near, and for John Lilburne
the days of “carnal sword-fighting and fleshly
hustlings and contests” were over. He wrote to
Cromwell from Dover Castle telling the Lord
Protector of his conversion to Quakerism, and
Cromwell, assured that there was to be no more
agitation from “Free-Born John,” granted his
release, and a pension of 40s. a week.</p>

<p>The battle was over for John Lilburne, liberty
could not stay the hand of death. The many imprisonments
and close confinements had done their
work, and rapid consumption marked down the man
who had stood up against the whole might of
Cromwell’s government.</p>

<p>John Lilburne died at Eltham in August, 1657,
at the age of forty. A year later, and his old
antagonist, and older comrade-in-arms, Oliver
Cromwell, Lord Protector, was dead, and the
Commonwealth government which had contemned
the agitation for democracy was doomed.</p>

<h3 class="left">WINSTANLEY THE DIGGER
<span class="subhead">1649–1650.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">In</span> the spring of 1649, the “Digger” movement
revealed a strange and unexpected manifestation
of the democratic spirit in England.
Free communism had been the creed of more
than one Protestant sect on the continent in the
sixteenth century, and the Anabaptists had been
conspicuously identified with the proposal. But in
England John Lilburne and the Levellers were
attacking the parliamentary government in the
name of political democracy, and social agitation
had been unknown since the Norfolk Rising of
1549, save for a riot against land enclosures at the
beginning of James I.’s reign.</p>

<p>Gerrard Winstanley was the leader at the sudden
outbreak of social discontent, and his “Digger”
movement was to end this discontent and all other
miseries of the time by getting rid of enclosures of
common lands, and allowing people to plough these
common lands and waste spaces, “that all may feed
upon the crops of the earth, and the burden of
poverty be removed.”</p>

<p>Little is known of Winstanley, and the movement
is shortlived. The “Diggers” never threatened
the safety of the Commonwealth government as
Lilburne and the Levellers did, for Winstanley’s
social doctrine included the non-resistance principles
that later found exponents in the Society of Friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and the agrarian revolution he preached could
hardly be accomplished without force of arms.
What is notable about Winstanley is his witness to
the fact that a social question existed—that he saw
beyond the Civil War, and the strife for political
liberties, a great mass of poverty unheeded; and
seeing the miseries of his fellows resolutely thought
out some cure for their distress, and did his best, as
it seemed to him, to get this cure adopted.</p>

<p>Neither the Council of State nor the republican
army had time or patience for Winstanley’s schemes,
and the “Diggers” were dispersed with little
trouble; but Winstanley’s religious teaching was
to exercise considerable influence in the world
when George Fox became its preacher, and his
social teaching on the land question has thousands
of disciples in Great Britain to-day.</p>

<p>Gerrard Winstanley was born in Lancashire in
1609.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> He seems to have settled in London as a
small trader and to have lost what money he had in
business—cheated he says, “in the thieving art of
buying and selling, and by the burdens of and for
the soldiery in the beginning of the war”—so that
he was obliged “to accept of the good-will of
friends to live a country life.” In the country Winstanley
ponders the source of the ills around him,
and, having some considerable gift of expression,
gives utterance, in a number of pamphlets, to a cry
for reform, and gathers followers.</p>

<p>In December, 1648, Winstanley (or one of his
friends) issued the earliest of the Digger publications
under the title of “Light Shining in Buckinghamshire—A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Discovery of the Main Ground,
Original Cause of all the Slavery of the World, but
chiefly in England. Presented by way of a Declaration
of many of the Well-affected in that County, to
all their poor oppressed Countrymen in England.
And also to the consideration of the present army
under the conduct of the Lord Fairfax.”</p>

<p>A month later and Winstanley publishes his
“New Law of Righteousness: Budding forth to
restore the whole Creation from the Bondage of the
Curse. Or a glimpse of the new Heaven and the
new Earth, wherein dwells Righteousness.” Here,
with a good deal of mystical religious phrasing (the
author explains that when he was in a trance the
message came to him), Winstanley proclaims his
calling and unfolds his agrarian proposals:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And when the Lord doth show unto me the place and
manner, how He will have us that are called common people
manure and work upon the common lands, I will then go
forth and declare it by my action, to eat my bread by the
sweat of my brow, without either giving or taking hire,
looking upon the land as freely mine as another’s.</p></div>

<p>There is to be no forcible expropriation of landlords:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If the rich still hold fast to this propriety of Mine and
Thine, let them labour their own lands with their own
hands. And let the common people, that say the earth is
<em>ours</em>, not <em>mine</em>, let them labor together, and eat bread
together upon the commons, mountains, and hills.</p>

<p>For as the enclosures are called such a man’s land, and
such a man’s land, so the Commons and Heath are called the
common people’s. And let the world see who labor the
earth in righteousness, and those to whom the Lord gives
the blessing, let them be the people that shall inherit the
earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p>None can say that their right is taken from them. For
let the rich work alone by themselves; and let the poor work
together by themselves. The rich in their enclosures, saying,
<em>This is mine</em>; and the poor upon the commons, saying, <em>This
is ours, the earth and its fruits are common</em>. And who can be
offended at the poor for doing this? None but covetous,
proud, idle, pampered flesh, that would have the poor work
still for this devil (particular interest) to maintain his greatness
that he may live at ease.</p>

<p>Was the earth made for to preserve a few covetous,
proud men to live at ease, and for them to bag and barn up
the treasures of the earth from others, that these may beg or
starve in a fruitful land: or was it made to preserve all her
children? Let Reason and the Prophets’ and Apostles’
writings be judge.... For the earth is the Lord’s;
that is the spreading Power of Righteousness, not the
inheritance of covetous proud flesh that dies. If any man
can say that he makes corn or cattle, he may say, <em>That is
mine</em>. But if the Lord made these for the use of His creation,
surely then the earth was made by the Lord to be a Common
Treasury for all, not a particular treasury for some.</p>

<p>Leave off dominion and lordship one over another; for
the whole bulk of mankind are but one living earth. Leave
off imprisoning, whipping, and killing, which are but the
actings of the curse. Let those that have hitherto had no
land, and have been forced to rob and steal through poverty;
henceforth let them quietly enjoy land to work upon, that
everyone may enjoy the benefit of his creation, and eat his
own bread with the sweat of his own brows. For surely this
particular propriety of mine and thine hath brought in all
misery upon people. First it hath occasioned people to steal
from one another. Secondly it hath made laws to hang
those that did steal. It tempts people to do an evil action,
and then kills them for doing of it. Let all judge whether
this be not a great evil.</p></div>

<p>In April, 1649, the time was ripe—so Winstanley
and his friends judged—for making a start to get
rid of this evil.</p>

<p>The Council of State, but a few months old, and
much occupied with dangers in Scotland and Ireland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
and with mutinous Levellers in the army, was suddenly
informed of the strange activities of “a
disorderly and tumultuous sort of people” by one
Henry Sanders, of Walton-upon-Thames.</p>

<p>Sanders’ testimony affirmed that “there was one
Everard, once of the army but was cashiered, who
termeth himself a prophet, one Stewer and Colten,
and two more, all living at Cobham, came to St.
George’s Hill in Surrey, and began to dig on that
side the hill next to Camp Close, and sowed the
ground with parsnips, carrots, and beans. On
Monday following they were there again, being
increased in their number, and on the next day they
fired the heath, and burned at least forty rood of
heath, which is a very great prejudice to the town.
On Friday last they came again, between twenty
and thirty, and wrought all day at digging. They
did then intend to have two or three ploughs at
work, but they had not furnished themselves with
seed-corn, which they did on Saturday at Kingston.
They invite all to come in and help them, and
promise them meat, drink, and clothes. They do
threaten to pull down and level all park pales, and
lay open, and intend to plant there very shortly.
They give out they will be four or five thousand
within ten days, and threaten the neighbouring
people there, that they will make them all come up
to the hills and work: and forewarn them suffering
their cattle to come near the plantation; if they do,
they will cut their legs off. It is feared they have
some design in hand.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>The date of this information was April 16th, and
Bradshaw, the President of the Council, at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
asked General Fairfax “to disperse the people so
met, and to prevent the like for the future, that a
malignant and disaffected party may not under colour
of such ridiculous people have any opportunity to
rendezvous themselves in order to do a greater
mischief.”</p>

<p>Fairfax sent Captain John Gladman to attend to
the matter, and Gladman reports three days later
that Mr. Winstanley and Mr. Everard are the chief
men responsible, that he “cannot hear that there
have been above twenty of them together since they
first undertook the business,” and that Mr. Winstanley
and Mr. Everard will wait upon Lord Fairfax.
He adds; “I believe you will be glad to be rid of
them again, especially Everard, who is no other
than a mad man. I intend to go with two or three
men to St. George’s Hill this day and persuade
these people to leave this employment if I can, and
if then I see no more danger than now I do I shall
march back again to London to-morrow.” Gladman’s
opinion is that “the business is not worth the
writing nor yet taking notice of.”</p>

<p>The interview between Fairfax and Winstanley
and Everard took place on April 20, and Everard
explained that the Diggers “did not intend to
meddle with any man’s property nor to break down
any pales or enclosures, but only to meddle with
what was common and untilled, and to make it
fruitful for the use of man: that they will not defend
themselves by arms, but will submit unto authority;
that as their forefathers lived in tents, so it would
be suitable to their condition now to live in the
same.”</p>

<p>Fairfax evidently decided that the movement was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
not so alarming as the Council of State had represented,
for Winstanley and his Diggers resumed
their work, and at the end of May, Fairfax, with
the officers of the army, paid a visit to St. George’s
Hill. Winstanley returned “sober answers” to the
inquiries of Fairfax, “though they gave little satisfaction
(if any at all) in regard of the strangeness of
their action.” Winstanley’s argument, often enlarged
in his pamphlets, was that the people were dispossessed
of their lands by the crown at the Norman
Conquest, and that “the king who possessed them
by the Norman Conquest being dead, they were
returned again, being Crown Lands, to the Common
People of England.”</p>

<p>This was not conclusive to their visitors, and
“some officers wished they had no further plot in
what they did, and that no more was intended than
what they did pretend.” To the objection that the
ground was too poor to repay cultivation, “the
Diggers answered they would use their endeavours
and leave the success to God, who had promised to
make the barren ground fruitful.” Public opinion
gave out that the Diggers were “sober, honest
men,” and that “the ground will probably in a short
time yield them some fruit of their labour, how
contemptible soever they do yet appear to be.”</p>

<p>Encouraged by Fairfax’s “kindness and moderation,”
Winstanley appeals to him in June against
the interference of the local landowners, and getting
no response (for Fairfax had said that the Diggers
were to be left to “the Gentlemen of the County
and the Law of the Land”), publishes an appeal to
the House of Commons against his arrest for trespass
by the Lords of Manors in Surrey. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
House of Commons, occupied with State matters,
turned an indifferent ear to Winstanley’s complaint,
and the leader of the Diggers sent a “Watchword
to the City of London and the Army,” telling the
wrongs the Diggers suffered at the hands of the
law for “digging upon the barren common”—how
they were mulcted in damages at £10 a man, with
costs at twenty-nine shillings and a penny, and taken
in execution, and how their cows were seized by the
bailiffs. At the end of November the very huts
they had built were pulled down, and it was a hard
winter for the little colony still left on St. George’s
Hill.</p>

<p>Winstanley does not merely relate his injuries in
these publications, he is all the time urging that his
plan for setting people upon the common lands is
the needful thing in England, that a common ownership
of land is God’s will, and that the crown lands
taken by the Normans must revert to the people on
the execution of the king.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1650 an attempt was made to
extend the digging propaganda—for the planting of
St. George’s Hill was doomed—and some of Winstanley’s
disciples made a tour through the counties
of Middlesex, Bedford, Hertford, Huntingdon, and
Northampton, settling down at last on some waste
ground near Wellingborough. Here they were
very soon arrested by a local justice of the peace,
the Council of State ordered their prosecution, and
the movement was suppressed.</p>

<p>To the Council of State these Diggers were
“Levellers,”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> “intruders upon other men’s properties,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
“seditious and tumultuous,” against whom the
public peace must be preserved.</p>

<p>Of Winstanley’s future, when the days of the
digging were over, nothing seems to be known.
Only one pamphlet is issued by him after 1650—“The
Law of Freedom in a Platform; or, True
Magistracy Restored”—an open letter to Oliver
Cromwell, February, 1652. With this final manifesto
on the land question, and on the whole social
question, as he saw it, Gerrard Winstanley disappears
from history. In the multitude of prophets
and preachers, visionaries and practical reformers of
the Commonwealth, Winstanley is little heeded by
his contemporaries. The importance of his mission
is seen more clearly to-day, when statesmen, politicians,
and philanthropists all urge agrarian changes
and the excellence of land culture.</p>

<p>As to Winstanley’s claim on behalf of the people
to the common lands, the advantage of possession
of these lands was realized by the landowners in
the eighteenth century, and from 1760 to 1830 more
than a thousand acts of parliament were passed for
enclosing these lands.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>In “The Diggers Song,” (of unknown authorship<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>),
the outlook of Winstanley and his followers is
expressed in popular form:</p>

“THE FATHER OF REFORM”
<span class="subhead">1775–1824.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> substance of Major Cartwright’s life is
told on the pedestal beneath his statue in
the dingy garden of Burton Crescent, to
the south of Euston Road, in London.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center large wspace">JOHN CARTWRIGHT,</p>

<p class="center">Born 28th September, 1740. Died 23rd September, 1824.</p>

<p class="in0">The Firm, Consistent and Persevering Advocate of <em>Universal
Suffrage</em>, Equal Representation, Vote by Ballot and Annual
Parliaments.</p>

<p class="in0">He was the first English Writer who openly maintained the
Independence of the United States of America, and although
his distinguished merits as a Naval Officer in 1776 presented
the most flattering Prospects of Professional Advancement,
yet he nobly refused to draw his Sword against the Rising
Liberties of an oppressed and struggling People.</p>

<p class="in0">In Grateful Commemoration of his inflexible integrity, exalted
Patriotism, “profound Constitutional Knowledge,” and in sincere
admiration of the unblemished Virtues of his Private Life,</p>

<p class="center larger">THIS STATUE</p>

<p class="center">was erected by Public Subscription near the spot where he
closed his useful and meritorious career.</p></div>

<p>There is nothing false or exaggerated in this
epitaph. Fox, in the House of Commons, testified
to Cartwright’s “profound constitutional knowledge.”
Hazlitt, who never met Cartwright, classed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
him with the men of one idea (and lingered over the
subject), but the charge is ill-founded. It is true that
for nearly fifty years, in season and out of season,
Cartwright, a pupil of Locke in politics, contended
publicly for annual parliaments and manhood suffrage,
claiming personality and not property as the
ground for enfranchisement, and insisting that while
the right of the rich and the poor to the vote was
equal, the need of the latter was far greater. But
this agitation was by no means the limit either of his
ideas or his activities.</p>

<p>Entering the navy at eighteen, John Cartwright,
who came of an old Nottingham family, devised
improvements in the gun service, and, made a lieutenant,
was marked for high promotion. The revolt
of the American colonies cut short his professional
career. An innate love of liberty compelled the
young naval officer to side with the colonists, and he
writes in 1776 that it is a mistaken notion that the
planting of colonies and the extending of empire are
necessarily the same things. Self-governing colonies,
he declares, bound to England only by “the ties of
blood and mutual interests, by sincere love and
friendship, which abhors dependence, and by
every other cementing principle which hath power
to take hold of the human heart,” are to be
desired.</p>

<p>Lord Howe put Cartwright’s principles to the test
by inviting him to join the expedition against the
Americans, and Cartwright, who was “passionately
attached to the navy,” and had an immense admiration
for Howe, could only answer that he was unable
to take part in a war he thought unjust. With this
refusal his naval services were ended, in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
Howe’s quiet and dignified reply that “opinions in
politics are to be treated like opinions in religion.”
(No word of reproach came from Howe, no taunt of
want of courage or lack of patriotism.)</p>

<p>Cartwright never condemned all war. He urged
in a letter to a nephew in the army that the answer
to the question of the justice or injustice of a war
decided whether justifiable homicide or wilful murder
was committed by those engaged in battle. He
hated standing armies and barracks and barrack life,
and all the pomp and glory of militarism, as heartily
as he hated the attempt to coerce the colonists. But
no sooner was he out of the navy than, with a major’s
commission, he at once set to work to train the Nottinghamshire
militia, only retiring from this post in
1791 when the government cancelled his appointment
for attending a meeting called to celebrate the
fall of the Bastille.</p>

<p>The militia in Cartwright’s view was strictly a
citizen army for home defence. “The militia,” he
wrote, “by its institution is not intended to spread
the dominion or to vindicate in war the honour of
the crown, but it is to preserve our laws and liberties,
and therein to secure the existence of the State.”
Thirteen years before the fall of the Bastille Major
Cartwright had the cap of liberty displayed on the
banners and engraved on the buttons of the Nottinghamshire
Militia. A greater service than providing
symbols of liberty was rendered to the army by
Cartwright in the matter of better clothing for the
men. The misery endured by ill-clad sentries
aroused his compassion and indignation, and Cartwright
worried the government until it provided
great-coats for all private soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>The humaner courage is as conspicuous in John
Cartwright’s long life as his political enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Four times he risked his life to save others from
drowning, rescuing two men from the Trent, a naval
officer at sea, and, in late middle-life, a small boy
who had fallen into the New River, near London.
In the year 1800, hearing of a riot planned at
Sheffield, Cartwright made his way alone to the
barn where the conspirators were assembled, and
stayed all night, reasoning with them against their
project. In the morning the confederates, dissuaded
from violence, quietly dispersed, and the riot was
prevented.</p>

<p>An untiring advocacy of democratic politics earned
for Cartwright, justly, the title of “The Father of
Reform.” He was the real founder of that movement
for political reform, which in the nineteenth
century swept away rotten boroughs, gave representation
to all towns of importance, and extended
the franchise to the great bulk of male householders
in town and country; which to-day presses towards
a general suffrage for men and women.</p>

<p>Major Cartwright began his speeches and
pamphlets on behalf of political reform in 1776,
just after his retirement from the navy, and his
acceptance of the commission in the militia.</p>

<p>The ideas of the French Encyclopædists, the
writings of Rousseau, and the revolt of the American
colonists, had aroused a belief in social equality,
and the “natural” rights of man, and this belief
Cartwright championed till his death. His early
pamphlets, beginning with “Legislative Rights of
the Commonalty Vindicated,” (1777) are heavy
reading to-day, but in them Cartwright argued for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
all the famous “six points” of the People’s Charter
of fifty years later—Universal Manhood Suffrage,
Annual Parliaments, Vote by Ballot, Abolition of
Property Qualification for Parliamentary Candidates,
Payment of Members, and Equal Electoral Districts.
He even uses the modern phrase in urging “one
man one vote.”</p>

<p>Unlike Thomas Paine, and many of the “Radical
Reformers,” Cartwright pleads for political democracy
as the natural outcome of the Christian faith, maintaining
that “No man can have a right sense and
belief of Christianity who denies the equality of all
conditions of men.” Incidentally, challenged on the
point of why not Votes for Women? Cartwright
could only fall back on certain passages in the
Bible to justify his objection to Women’s Enfranchisement.
Nothing was more abhorrent to his
mind than the notion that government was a matter
for “experts,” an exclusive affair for persons with
specially trained intelligences. “Of all the errors
to which mankind have ever submitted their understandings,”
he wrote, “there is no one to be more
lamented than that of conceiving the business of
civil government to be above the comprehension of
ordinary capacities.”</p>

<p>The poor, because of their very poverty, had a
need for the vote and for parliamentary representation
which the man of property could not experience.
This Cartwright emphasised in a petition he presented
to the House of Commons as late as 1820:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And when your Honourable House shall further consider
that the humblest mortal on earth is equally a co-heir of an
immortality with the most exalted who now wears stars, or
coronets, or crowns, your petitioner hopes that your Honourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
House will rise superior to the mean thoughts and vulgar
prejudices of the uncharitable among the wealthy, the ignorant,
the interested, the vain, and the proud; and will acknowledge
that, in reference to the respective claims of legislative representation
by the poor and the rich, the poor have equal right
but far more need.</p></div>

<p>Enthusiasm and an entirely disinterested zeal for
democracy kept the spirit of youth in Cartwright,
and carried him at the age of 80 over a trial for
sedition undisturbed. His zeal was not to be
quenched. “Moderation in practice may be commendable,”
he declared, “but moderation in principle
is detestable. Can we trust a man who is moderately
honest, or esteem a woman who is moderately
virtuous?”</p>

<p>This very allegiance to principle had its drawbacks
in the world of practical politics, of corruption
and compromise. Three times Major Cartwright
stood for parliament: for the county of Nottingham
in 1780, for Boston in 1806 and 1807; and on each
occasion he was at the bottom of the poll. His
nominations for Westminster in 1818 and 1819
received no serious support at all. The old major
was no more distressed by any feeling of personal
disappointment at these defeats than he was cast
down at seeing no signs of the triumph of political
democracy in his lifetime. At eighty-four we find
him writing cheerfully, “To despair in a good cause
is to approach towards atheism.”</p>

<p>Cartwright did not live to see the passage of the
great Reform Bill of 1832. Wilkes’ motion for
reform in 1776 had been negatived in the House of
Commons without a division. In 1780 the Duke
of Richmond’s motion in the House of Lords for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
manhood suffrage and annual parliaments was
mocked by the outbreak of the Gordon (“No
Popery”) Riots in London on the very day the
motion was made. Pitt’s third and last effort for
parliamentary reform was rejected in 1785. The
French Revolution turned men’s minds in Great
Britain towards democracy, but reaction followed
hard on the Terror in Paris, and for a time a
government terror crushed every expression in
favour of political liberty in England. Sir Francis
Burdett became the parliamentary leader of the
“radical reformers” early in the nineteenth century,
and in 1809 found fifteen supporters in the House of
Commons. Ten years later the government, in the
face of a strong working-class movement for political
reform, brought out the military against the people
at a peaceful meeting held at Peterloo, near Manchester,
and followed this up by six repressive acts
of parliament, and a general prosecution of the
leaders of the reform agitation.</p>

<p>Cartwright was eighty when, with several friends, he
was charged “with being a malicious, seditious, evil-minded
person, and with unlawfully and maliciously
intending and designing to raise disaffection and
discontent in the minds of his majesty’s subjects.”</p>

<p>All England knew that Major Cartwright was a
single-minded and high-principled man, in whose
heart was neither guile nor malice, a man who had
proved his loyalty and patriotism over and over
again, and was no more seditious than he was evil-minded
or disaffected. Apart from his advocacy of
political reform and his services to the militia, Cartwright
had done much for farming and agriculture,
he had helped Clarkson and Wilberforce in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
anti-slavery work, and he had called the attention
of the government, as loudly as he could, to the
defenceless state of the east coast against foreign
invasion. Yet in 1820 a British jury, obedient
to the orders of a political judge, found John
Cartwright guilty of “maliciously intending and
designing to raise disaffection and discontent,” and
a fine of £100 was inflicted.</p>

<p>Francis Place, the radical tailor of Charing Cross,
in whose shop the later Chartists and Reformers were
to be found, gives his impression of Major Cartwright
as he knew him in old age:</p>

<p>“When he was in town he used frequently to sup
with me, eating some raisins he brought in his pocket,
and drinking weak gin and water. He was cheerful,
agreeable, and full of curious anecdote. He was,
however, in political matters exceedingly troublesome
and sometimes as exceedingly absurd. He
had read but little, or to little purpose, and knew
nothing of general principles. He entertained a
vague and absurd notion of the political arrangements
of the Anglo-Saxons, and sincerely believed
that these semi-barbarians were not only a political
people, but that their ‘twofold polity,’ arms-bearing
and representation, were universal and perfect.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>To Place, chief political wire-puller of his age,
industrious and persistent in getting things done,
with a typical cockney politician’s scorn of disinterested
enthusiasm, Major Cartwright appeared
“troublesome” and “absurd”—Francis Place had
quite an honest liking for the “old gentleman,” as
he called him, all the same. By the government
Cartwright stood convicted as a “seditious, evil-minded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
person.” Posterity is content to know
John Cartwright by the title his contemporaries
conferred upon him—the Father of Reform—and
to rank him as the foremost man in England in
the eighteenth century to raise the standard of
Political Democracy.</p>

<h3 class="left">ERNEST JONES AND<br />
CHARTISM
<span class="subhead">1838–1854.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">The</span> Chartist agitation was at once the
largest, the most revolutionary, and the
least successful of all the serious political
movements of the first half of the nineteenth
century. For ten years, with varying
fortune, it threatened the authority of parliament,
and then slowly expired—destroyed by its own
internal weakness and the quarrels of its leaders
rather than by the repression of the government.</p>

<p>The failure of the great Reform Act of 1832 to
accomplish any particular improvement in the lot of
the mass of working people brought the Chartist
movement to life,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and roused the politically minded
leaders of the workmen to agitate for changes in the
constitution that would place political power in the
hands of the whole people.</p>

<p>The six points of the Charter, embodied in the
“People’s Charter” drawn up by Francis Place and
Lovett in 1838, revived the old programme of
Major Cartwright and, in substance, the earlier
demands of John Lilburne and the Levellers.
Universal manhood suffrage, the ballot, payment of
members of parliament, equal electoral districts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
abolition of property qualification for members, and
annual parliaments, these were the “six points” of
the Charter, the platform of its advocates, and for
ten years the hope of multitudes of earnest and
devoted men and women.</p>

<p>Francis Place and the Working-Men’s Association
which gave Chartism its name and programme
never had any considerable voice in its direction.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>Feargus O’Connor, who had sat in parliament
from 1832 to 1835 for an Irish constituency, was
from the first the real leader of the movement. His
personality and his rhetorical powers roused the
manufacturing districts in the North and the
Midlands to form political unions for the Charter in
1838, and his presence dominated the first Convention,
held in London, with Lovett for its
secretary. Later, O’Connor’s obvious weaknesses,
his vanity and egotism, his want of self-control and
that “one fatal disqualification for a leader of
revolt—the fear of the police”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>—left leadership in
his hands, but left him a leader without followers.</p>

<p>Next to O’Connor stood another Irish orator,
James Bronterre O’Brien, a man of finer character,
and clearer head, but smaller gifts of command.</p>

<p>South Wales, the manufacturing districts of
Lancashire and Yorkshire, and towns like Birmingham,
Leicester, and Northampton, were the strongholds
of Chartism, and “in the dark days of the late
thirties and early forties it was a real and dangerous
power.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Feargus O’Connor never advocated an
armed rising, and advised the abandonment of the
huge torchlight processions; but pikes were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
fashioned and men were being drilled in preparation
for a revolution that was to end the Whig rule, and
give the working classes the reins of government.
The circulation of the <i>Northern Star</i>, O’Connor’s
weekly paper, stood at 50,000 in those days.</p>

<p>Riots at Newport (Monmouth) and Birmingham
in 1839, followed by several arrests and imprisonments
of the Chartist leaders the following year,
ended for the time all notions of a successful
revolution. Lord John Russell declared strongly
against manhood suffrage when the question was
raised in the House of Commons, and on a division
in the House the petition for the Charter was rejected
by 237 to 48 votes.</p>

<p>The outbreak at Birmingham, provoked, in the
first place, by the interference of a body of London
police with an orderly meeting in the Bull Ring,
was put down in two days by the soldiers; but not
till many houses had been attacked and a considerable
amount of property destroyed. No robberies
or petty thefts accompanied the riot.</p>

<p>At Newport the harsh prison treatment of Vincent,
a Chartist advocate, convicted for what was held to
be a political offence, brought a crowd of 10,000
men, led by Frost, William, and Jones, to demand
his release. The insurgents had a few rifles and
pikes, but were generally unarmed, and the fire of
the military soon overpowered them. But lives
were lost on both sides, and Frost and his two
lieutenants were sentenced to death, though the
sentence was at once reduced to transportation for
life, and some years later to simple banishment from
British dominions.</p>

<p>Feargus O’Connor, Bronterre O’Brien, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
chief speakers of the movement were brought to
trial for seditious utterance in 1840, and in most
cases sent to prison either for twelve months or two
years.</p>

<p>With these imprisonments and the general election
of 1841 came the first serious disintegration of the
Chartist movement.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> O’Brien and O’Connor differed
vigorously on the question of election policy, and
before they were released from prison were expressing
their opinions in the <i>Northern Star</i>. O’Connor,
full of wrath at the repressive treatment meted out
to Chartists by the Whig Government, was for
attacking the Whigs at the election, and O’Brien
objected to this as a pro-Tory policy.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>The decision to run independent Chartist candidates
for parliament in certain constituencies, and
the failure of these candidates to get returned on
the limited franchise of 1832, increased disunion in
the Chartist ranks and brought demoralisation.</p>

<p>To make matters worse for the movement, several
prominent Chartists left prison with fresh notions
and ideas of reform, which had come to them in
their long hours of solitude and reflection. Lovett,
imprisoned in connection with the Birmingham riot,
though he was entirely innocent of giving any
encouragement to violence, on his release was full
of vast plans for national education, convinced that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
education must precede political democracy. Vincent
had become a strong temperance advocate, and
henceforth must give himself to the work of a
teetotal lecturer. Other men were for bringing in
religion by “Chartist Churches.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Antagonism to
the anti-corn law league of Cobden and Bright,
and later his own “National Land Company” experiments,
withdrew Feargus O’Connor from actual
Chartist propaganda.</p>

<p>The movement languished. But in spite of
government repression, the indifference of parliament,
the hostility of the wealthier classes, and its
own jarring elements of discord, Chartism was not
dead.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The misery of the English people kept it from
death. With one in every eleven of the industrial
population a pauper in 1842, general satisfaction with
the state of government was impossible for men of
strong social sympathies. Some exerted themselves,
like Sadler and Oastler, in following Lord Shaftesbury’s
entirely disinterested and successful crusade
against the horrors of factory oppression. Others
supported the Free Trade agitation.</p>

<p>To one man, Ernest Jones, it seemed, in 1845,
that before all else must come political enfranchisement,
that the social miseries and discontents of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
England were not to be cured save by the people
of England. The evils might be mitigated by
ameliorative legislation, but it was not enough that
the decencies of life—then very far beyond the
reach of the mass of town and country labourers—should
be secured for people; the main thing
was that people should have freedom to work out
their own industrial salvation.</p>

<p>So in 1846, Ernest Jones plunged boldly into
Chartism. He quickly became a leader, and his
reputation has endured: for Ernest Jones was the
most respected, single-minded, and steadfast of the
many who sat in Chartist conventions. Chartism
for him was the cry of the uncared-for, because
voteless, multitudes, and Ernest Jones was ready to
give his life that the cry should move the rulers of
the nation.</p>

<p>It was a bad time for England in 1846,
that was plain,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> and Ernest Jones, believing with
the average Englishman that in politics lay the key
to necessary change, was henceforth a Chartist
advocate and till his death the faithful preacher of
democracy. Without becoming a socialist, Ernest
Jones, in his “Songs of Democracy” and in his
speeches and newspaper writings, is clear that
political enfranchisement was but the high road to
social and economic reform, that the Charter was
to bring a better distribution of wealth as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
consequence of a better distribution of political
power.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Ernest Jones was twenty-seven when he joined
the Chartist movement. The son of an army
officer—who had been equerry to the Duke of
Cumberland—and educated on the continent,
Ernest Jones came to England when he was
nineteen, and was duly presented to Queen Victoria
(as Robert Owen had been) by Lord Melbourne
in 1841. He married a Miss Atherley, of Cumberland,
and settled down in London, writing
novels, verses, and newspaper articles. In 1844
he was called to the Bar, and two years later
took the step which separated him from the friends
and acquaintances of his social order, and placed
him on the hard and strenuous road of the political
agitator.</p>

<p>Averse from faction, realising the fatal folly of
internal jealousies and strife, and alive to the importance
of discipline in the army of revolt, Ernest
Jones did his best to work with O’Connor—and was
naturally charged with cowardice by the Chartists
who hated O’Connor’s supremacy. In 1847 he
began writing in the <i>Northern Star</i>, and was joint
editor with O’Connor of <i>The Labourer</i>. His
“Songs of Democracy” were to the Chartists what
Ebenezer Elliott’s “Corn-Law Rhymes” were to
the Free Traders, and his “Song of the Lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Classes” has retained a place in the song-books of
social democrats to our own day.</p>

<p>At the general election of 1847, when, to everybody’s
astonishment, Feargus O’Connor was elected
member for Nottingham, Ernest Jones stood for
Halifax, but though immensely popular at the
hustings, he only polled 280 votes.</p>

<p>1848, the memorable year of revolutions abroad,
saw Chartism once more a formidable movement
in England. An enormous petition was again
prepared for parliament, and the Chartists decided
to carry the petition to the House of Commons
after a mass meeting on Kennington Common on
April 10th. Lord John Russell and his Whig
government became thoroughly alarmed. The
Duke of Wellington, as commander-in-chief, undertook
to guard the safety of London, and garrisoned
the city with troops, and protected the bridges,
while 70,000 special constables (of whom Prince
Louis Napoleon was one) were quickly enrolled.
But on the government prohibition of any procession
to Westminster, Feargus O’Connor at once
decided against any collision between the people
and the authorities. The mass meeting was held,
some 50,000 persons were present, and O’Connor
and Ernest Jones made speeches. Then the
petition was sent off in a cab to parliament, and all
was over.</p>

<p>O’Connor had boasted that the monster petition
contained 5,000,000 signatures, but on investigation
it was found that the signatures only amounted to
1,975,496, and many of these were duplicates and
forgeries. Anti-Chartists had signed in several
places, using ridiculous names, like “Pugnose,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
“Punch,” and “Fubbs,” or boldly signing as
“Queen Victoria” and “Duke of Wellington.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
Parliament gladly took advantage of O’Connor’s
characteristic exaggeration to discredit the whole
movement. At the same time the government
hastily prepared a bill to suppress the renewed
agitation, and the “Treason Felony” bill was passed,
making “open and advised speaking with seditious
intent” a crime. This clause in the act only remained
on the statute book for two years, but it was
sufficient for securing the conviction of all prominent
Chartist speakers.</p>

<p>Ernest Jones, unlike Feargus O’Connor, believed
that the people should arm, and that a display of
force was necessary for carrying the Charter. The
failure of April 10th strengthened this belief, and
for the next two months he was busy speaking in
England and Scotland, urging the necessity for
enrolling a national guard and forming a provisional
government.</p>

<p>But in spite of great public meetings the movement
was already breaking up. The Chartist
Convention, which met in London on May 1st,
dissolved on May 13th in hopeless disagreement, and
Ernest Jones, who had attended as a member of
the executive committee, exclaimed that “amid the
desertion of friends, and the invasion of enemies,
the fusee had been trampled out, and the elements
of their energy were scattered to the winds of
heaven.” Still he tried to rally the broken ranks,
and the government decided that the time had come
to put the movement down by means of the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
“Treason Felony” Act. Feargus O’Connor, now
a member, was no longer dangerous to the authorities.
His attendance in the House kept him from
the agitation in the country, and Ernest Jones was
the man to be struck at.</p>

<p>On May 29th and 30th Ernest Jones addressed
great, but quite orderly, meetings in London, on
Clerkenwell Green and Bishop Bonner’s Fields, and
then proceeded to Manchester. Here he was arrested
and put on trial with five other Chartists—Fussell,
Sharpe, Williams, Vernon, and Looney. The
judge had little patience for the prisoners, and
Ernest Jones was frequently interrupted in his
defence. In the end, he and his fellows were all
found guilty of seditious speech, and Ernest Jones
was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, to find
sureties, himself in £200 and two persons in £150,
and to keep the peace for five years.</p>

<p>A number of police spies procured many more
arrests and convictions by gaining admission to
Chartist meetings, joining Chartist unions and inciting
the members to violent speech and an armed conspiracy.
By these means at the end of the year
1848 the government had succeeded in getting the
prominent Chartists into prison, as it had done in
1840. That Ernest Jones exhorted his followers to
learn to bear arms is indisputable; that the success
of the revolutionary movements on the continent
encouraged the belief amongst a certain number of
Chartists that an armed rising was desirable and
could be successful in England is equally true. But
as no serious attempt was made in 1848 by the
“physical force” Chartists to organize such a rising,
no rising took place, and “the conspiracy,” as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
called, was chiefly the work of the government’s
police spies.</p>

<p>The riots at Newport and Birmingham gave some
excuse to the government for repression in 1839–40;
in 1848 no outbreaks were even threatened to justify
the sentences on Ernest Jones and other Chartist
speakers. The government’s chief concern was to
end the agitation, even if this could only be accomplished
by means of a special act of parliament, and
the unsavoury methods of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agents provocateurs</i>. Lord
John Russell and his Whig colleagues were not the
men to be kept from their purpose by any nice
discrimination in the choice of weapons. It was not
the time, when crowns were falling on the continent,
to hesitate about crushing a movement which seemed
to menace public safety in England. That the
strength of Chartism was in the sober, law-abiding
character of most of its adherents the government
knew no more than they knew that the movement
was already doomed for want of cohesion.</p>

<p>The bitter hostility of the government pursued
Ernest Jones in prison, and left him to be treated as
a common felon. Ordered to pick oakum he refused,
and was put on a diet of bread and water. The
struggle between the prisoner and his gaolers was at
last brought before the House of Commons,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> and in
the end Ernest Jones was allowed to purchase
exemption from the allotted prison tasks by a small
payment of money.</p>

<p>On his release from prison the Chartist movement
was flickering out. It was impossible to work with
O’Connor, who, now looking favourably on household
suffrage, was already failing in health and showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
signs of the insanity which possessed him two years
later. The trade-union movement and the co-operative
store were attracting the attention of
intelligent workmen, to whom for the time political
enfranchisement seemed a lost cause. Contesting
Halifax in 1852, Ernest Jones only polled 52 votes,
and the <i>People’s Paper</i>, which he started in that
year and edited, never had the success of the
<i>Northern Star</i>.</p>

<p>Feargus O’Connor was led away from the House
of Commons hopelessly insane, to die in 1855, and
Chartism utterly disintegrated could not be revived
by Ernest Jones. In 1854 the movement was
extinct, and from that time till his death Ernest
Jones gave his political support to the advanced
Radicals. He contested Nottingham in 1853 and
1857, but without success, returned to his old
practice at the Bar, and wrote novels and poems.
In 1868, the year of household suffrage in the towns,
he was adopted by the Radicals as parliamentary
candidate for Manchester, and then on January 26,
1869, came a sudden failure of the heart, and death
ended all earthly hopes and plans for Ernest Jones.
He was just fifty when he died, and though Chartism
had passed away, Ernest Jones had not outlived his
usefulness or his popularity with all those who believed
in the ultimate triumph of democracy, and he
had gained the respect of many earlier foes.</p>

<p>The People’s Charter remains unfulfilled, but two
of its points have long been granted—the ballot,
and the abolition of a property qualification for
members of parliament. Annual parliaments are no
longer desired by any section of political reformers,
the extension of the franchise to the agricultural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
labourer in 1884 brought manhood suffrage appreciably
nearer, equal electoral districts were never
more than a plan of quite reasonable political
theorists, and the demand for payment of members,
never altogether dropped by Radicals, is once more
heard in the land.</p>

<p>The great contention of Ernest Jones and the
Chartists that political liberty should precede the
granting of reforms by parliament, that the people
should have the power to control and direct the
deliberations of parliaments still has its advocates;
but government is passing—almost unnoticed—once
more into the hands of an executive, for that “eternal
vigilance” which is the price of political liberty is
oftentimes relaxed.</p>

<h3 class="left">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">Two</span> political movements may be noted
to-day in Great Britain by all who are
interested in such things: the Labour
movement and the Women’s movement
for political enfranchisement.</p>

<p>The efforts of the past twenty-five years to
establish a separate socialist party in parliament
have not been directly successful, but the Labour
Party has managed to return a group of some thirty
workmen to the House of Commons, and these
men are the responsible and trusted leaders of the
trade-unions and the Independent Labour Party.
Without requiring any formal acknowledgment of
socialist belief, the Labour Party is largely inspired
by socialist teaching, and its goal is the conquest
of government by the labouring people, and a
more even distribution of wealth by the gradual
expropriation of the landlord and the capitalist.
While adhering strictly to constitutional methods of
agitation, giving full respect to the procedure of
parliament and the legal conduct of elections, the
leaders of the Labour Party, in their speeches at
public meetings, use much of the old revolutionary
talk of John Ball and Robert Ket, and the arguments
of Winstanley for the popular ownership of
the land. To the Labour Party as to the Chartists
democratic politics are but a stepping-stone to social
reform, and as in the days of the Chartists the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
strength of the Labour Party is in the industrial
districts of the North of England, and in South
Wales.</p>

<p>The Women’s movement, on the other hand, while
demanding nothing but the right to the franchise,
and claiming this right to a voice in the affairs of
the State on the old constitutional ground of Pym
and Hampden—that those who pay direct taxation
to the government must have some political control
of the expenditure—boldly avows in the face of
government refusal the necessity for revolutionary
methods to acquire the franchise. More than 600
women have gone to prison in the last four years in
the cause of Women’s Suffrage, and the methods
adopted have startled the public, created an enthusiasm,
and generally aroused the attention of a
formerly indifferent parliament to the claim of
women to political enfranchisement.</p>

<p>Mary Wollstonecraft, in her <cite>Vindication of the
Rights of Women</cite>, published in 1792, struck the
first note of this movement. In the latter half of
the nineteenth century it received the support of
John Stuart Mill and a certain number of parliamentary
radicals, and Women’s Suffrage societies
were formed. Then, five years ago, the Women’s
Social and Political Union was started at Manchester
by Mrs. Pankhurst and her daughter Miss Christabel
Pankhurst, and the extraordinary energy and activity
of this union and the daring and resource of its
members have made the women’s demand for the
vote a vital question in politics.</p>

<p>Both these movements—the agitation of the
Labour Party for a fuller and more abundant life
for wage-earners, and the agitation of the women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
for political enfranchisement are proceeding in our
midst—a guarantee that the centuries of struggle
for freedom are not fruitless.</p>

<p>“The battle of freedom is never done and the
field never quiet,” and while ever sun and moon
endure and man seeks to dominate his neighbour, so
long in England shall men and women be found to
resist such dominance. For “to meet such troubles
and overcome them, or to die in strife with them—this
is a great part of a man’s life.”</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> “The see of St. Peter was the acknowledged constitutional centre of
spiritual law in the West.... It was looked upon as the guide and
regulator of teaching, the tribunal and court from which issued the
oracles of right and discipline, the judgment seat to which an appeal
was open to all, and which gave sentence on wrong and vice without
fear or favour, without respect of persons, even the highest and the
mightiest.... If ever there was a time when the popes honestly
endeavoured to carry out the idea of their office, it was just at this
period of the Middle Ages. They attempted to erect an independent
throne of truth and justice above the passions and the force which
reigned in the world around.”—Church, <cite>Saint Anselm</cite>.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> “In England Anselm had stood only for right and liberty; he, the
chief witness for religion and righteousness, saw all round him vice
rampant, men spoiled of what was their own—justice, decency, honour
trampled under foot. Law was unknown, except to ensnare and
oppress. The King’s Court was the instrument of one man’s selfish and
cruel will, and of the devices of a cunning and greedy minister. The
natural remedies of wrong were destroyed and corrupted; the king’s
peace, the king’s law, the king’s justice, to which men in those days
looked for help, could only be thought of in mocking contrast to the
reality. Against this energetic reign of misrule and injustice, a resistance
as energetic was wanted; and to resist it was felt to be the call
and bounden duty of a man in Anselm’s place. He resisted, as was the
way in those days, man to man, person to person, in outright fashion
and plain-spoken words. He resisted lawlessness, wickedness, oppression,
corruption. When others acquiesced in the evil state, he refused;
and further, he taught a lesson which England has since largely learned,
though in a very different way. He taught his generation to appeal
from force and arbitrary will to law. It was idle to talk of appealing to
law in England; its time had not yet come.”—Church, <cite>Saint Anselm</cite>.</p>

they devastated, they destroyed. What they found in the houses
which they invaded and could not consume, they took to market to sell
for themselves or they burnt it. If it was liquor they would bathe the
feet of their horses in it or pour it on the ground. It shames me to
recall the cruelties they inflicted on the fathers of families and the
insults on their wives and daughters. And so, whenever the king’s
coming was known beforehand, people fled from their houses and hid
themselves and their goods, as far as they could, in the woods or wherever
safety might be found.”—Eadmer.</p>

clear it is this—that he was not in the least a man who pushed his Order
at the expense of his loyalty. More than once he refused to listen to an
ecclesiastical claim against the king, even when his old friend Theobald
was behind it: he was perfectly impartial: he taxed churchmen as he
taxed laymen, and in fact, so loyal and reasonable was he that Henry,
when he made him archbishop, seems to have thought that he was wholly
on his side. There were innumerable questions to be decided between
Church and State. Again and again small points came up as to the
appointment of this man or the other, as to the infliction or remission of
a fine; and again and again Thomas decided the cause and advised the
king on the merits of the case.... He was as zealous now for the
State as he was for the Church afterwards. There he stood Chancellor
of England; his business was to administer the laws, and he knew and
did his business.”—R. H. Benson, <cite>St. Thomas of Canterbury</cite>.</p>

fighting successfully, against the pope and the Church for the past six
years, he must make quite sure of gaining such an advantage as would
be worth the sacrifice. Mere release from excommunication and
interdict was certainly, in his eyes, not worth any sacrifice at all. To
change the pope from an enemy into a political friend was worth it, but—from
John’s point of view—only if the friendship could be made something
much more close and indissoluble than the ordinary official
relation between the pope and every Christian sovereign. He must
bind the pope to his personal interest by some special tie of such a
nature that the interest of the papacy itself would prevent Innocent
from casting it off or breaking it.... To outward personal
humiliation of any kind John was absolutely indifferent, when there was
any advantage to be gained by undergoing it. To any humiliation
which the crown or the nation might suffer in his person, he was indifferent
under all circumstances. His plighted faith he had never had a
moment’s hesitation in breaking, whether it were sworn to his father, his
brother, his allies or his people, and he would break it with equal
facility when sworn to the supreme pontiff.... There seems, in
short, to be good reason for believing that John’s homage to the pope
was offered without any pressure from Rome and on grounds of
deliberate policy.”—K. Norgate, <cite>John Lackland</cite>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> A well-known passage in Matthew Paris, vol. v, gives the monk’s
point of view of Grosseteste, the reformer:—“At this time the Bishop
of Lincoln made a visitation of the religious houses in the diocese. If
one were to tell all the acts of tyranny he committed therein, the bishop
would seem not merely unfeeling but inhuman in his severity. For
amongst other things when he came to Ramsey he went round the
whole place, examined each one of the monks’ beds in the dormitory,
scrutinized everything, and if he found anything locked up destroyed it.
He broke open the monks’ coffers as a thief would, and if he found any
cups wrought with decoration and with feet to stand on he broke them
to pieces, though it would have been wiser to have demanded them
unbroken for the poor. He also heaped the terrible curses of Moses on
the heads of those who disobeyed his injunctions and the blessings of
Moses on those who should observe the same.... And it is believed
all this he hath done to restrain from sin those over whom he hath
authority, and for whose souls he must give account.” This was written
in 1251, when Grosseteste had been sixteen years at Lincoln.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Grosseteste had been unable to get his way with the barons on the
question of legitimacy of children before legal wedlock. By the old
church law marriage made such children legitimate, and at the council
of Merton, in 1236, Grosseteste, with the bishops, tried to bring the
common law into union with the church view on this matter. He was
defeated, and to this day these children are illegitimate. “It would
indeed have been better if the independence exhibited by the majority
who opposed the prelates at Merton had been reserved for another
occasion; for it cannot be deemed that the perpetuation of a law contrary
to that which prevails on the subject in almost every European
country, and which still differentiates Scotland from England by abroad,
though unintelligible line of demarcation, has been open to grave
objection on grounds of public convenience, apart from any inherent
merits or demerits it may possess.”—F. S. Stevenson, <cite>Robert Grosseteste</cite>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> “Grosseteste, then, may be regarded in a threefold aspect; first, as a
reformer who sought to reform the Church from within and not from
without, by the removal of existing abuses, by the encouragement he
gave to the great religious revival of the early part of the 13th century,
and by the example of unflinching fearlessness and rectitude which he
set in his performance of the episcopal office; secondly, as the teacher
who guided the rising fortunes of the University of Oxford; and thirdly,
as the statesman who, applying to new conditions the policy associated
with the name of Stephen Langton, endeavoured to combine into one
effort the struggle of the clergy for the liberties of the Church with the
struggle of the laity for the liberties of the nation, imbued Simon de
Montfort with principles of ‘truth and justice’ which went far beyond
the mere maintenance of the privileges of his own order, and at the
same time, by his effort to reconcile him with his sovereign, and by the
whole tenour of his actions, showed that had he lived a few years longer,
his influence would have been directed to the task of achieving by
peaceful means the constitutional advance brought about by those
who, taking the sword, perished by the sword.”—Stevenson, <cite>Robert
Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln</cite>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Yet out of this letter and out of his great knowledge and love of the
Scriptures a notion has been current that Grosseteste was a forerunner
of Protestantism, and “a harbinger of the Reformation.” “If this
implies that he had any tendency towards the doctrinal changes
brought about in the Church at the Reformation, or that he evidenced
any idea of a separation of the Church of England from that of Rome,
a more utterly mistaken statement has never been made.”—Luard, Preface
to <cite>Grosseteste’s Letters</cite>. (Rolls Series.)</p>

<p>As for Grosseteste’s Scriptural knowledge, “The thorough familiarity
with the Old Testament is, perhaps, only what we might expect; but
the use which is made of the actions of all the characters of Scripture,
and the forced and sometimes outrageous way in which they are introduced
to illustrate his argument, show how thoroughly ‘biblical’ the age
was, and how completely the Old Testament history was regarded
rather as the guide of men’s conduct in Christian times, than as a mere
historical record of past events.”—<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ibid.</cite></p>

intended rather to fetter the king than to extend or develop the action
of the community at large. The baronial council clearly regards itself
as competent to act on behalf of all the estates of the realm, and the
expedient of reducing the national deliberations to three sessions of
select committees, betrays a desire to abridge the frequent and somewhat
irksome duty of attendance in parliament rather than to share the
central legislative and deliberative power with the whole body of the
people. It must however be remembered that the scheme makes a very

the old heathen philosophic creed, mellowed and spiritualised by

proposals were the authority of parliament: in the <em>sole</em> choice of the
ministers of the crown, in the regulation of state policy, in the management
of the militia, in the education of the royal children, in the
remodeling of the discipline of the Church of England; and the
guardianship by parliament of all forts and castles. It was of first
importance in Pym’s mind that parliament should have the control in
military matters. Without the power of the sword the House of
Commons could not ensure the personal safety of its members or the
privileges of free debate against the enmity of the king. To command
the army was to govern the country.</p>
